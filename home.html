    <h3>
        The Paper Mario series is one of fluctuation with highs as well as lows. Each game in the series has a
        very unique identity, with no two games playing the same. Having played each game to 100% completion, I am
        happy to share this series with you. This website will consist of overviews of the core aspects of each game, as
        well as some personal opinions thrown in on what things I like and dislike about each one. While this series'
        identity is certainly diverse, it is one of my favourite gaming series I have experienced in its entirety.

                    Paper Mario 64 is where the series began. This game gets a plathora of things right on its first
                    try. You can't go wrong with this one! It's got great gameplay, a fun story, and a unique art style
                    that stands the test of time. There's a wide cast of fun characters you will meet and interact with,
                    and the RPG gameplay is simple yet very enjoyable. The badge system is an aspect of the game that
                    makes it shine amongst its successors.

                    Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door is widely regarded as the best in the series! It iterated upon
                    its predecessor in major ways, adding new battle mechanics, a grander story, and even quirkier
                    characters! This game takes a lot more creative risks and goes for it, whereas the Paper Mario 64
                    was a lot more grounded in it creative scope. <abbr title="The Thousand Year Door">TTYD</abbr> also
                    introduces a lot more exploration and side-content beyond the main story making it feel like a full
                    course meal.

                    Super Paper Mario is quite possibly the most devisive in the series. Some love it, and some don't
                    like it. It was the first major departure from the RPG genre that the first two games had. Super
                    Paper Mario took its identity in a different direction; becoming a 2D platformer. Despite its
                    deviation from the standard, this game has fun and engaging gameplay, with extremely unique locales
                    and characters, and interesting puzzles to solve. It also just might have the single greatest story
                    ever told in a Mario game.

                    Unlike Super Paper Mario, which is a devicive title already, Paper Mario: Sticker Star is disliked
                    heavily by many. This game marks a significant divide between "Old Paper Mario" and "New Paper
                    Mario". While Sticker Star's overworld gameplay harkens back to the first two games, many fans
                    complain about its lack of RPG mechanics such as experience points or party members. Another large
                    flaw in this game is it is severely lacking in creative characters, locales, and a compelling story,
                    causing it to feel very lifeless to play.

                    What The Thousand Year Door was to Paper Mario 64 is what Paper Mario: Color Splash is to Sticker
                    Star. It has the same base mechanics, but iterates upon them. Therefore, many complaints about
                    Sticker Star carries over to Color Splash as well. The main ones being the lack of RPG mechanics and
                    unique characters. However, this game feels like a lot more soul has been put into it. There's more
                    fun writing, more interesting areas to visit, and a slightly more compelling story.

                    Paper Mario: The Origami King, the most recent release in the series, came out with much
                    anticipation
                    behind it. This game righted a lot of wrongs done by the previous two games, but still fell short in
                    other respects. This game has a much better story, more ambitious locations, and more fun characters
                    to interact with. It is also a very beautiful game, both visually and in terms of its soundtrack.
                    The battle system was completely revamped for this game, making it more
                    puzzle-like rather than turn-based strategy.
