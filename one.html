        Paper Mario 64 was the one that started it all. Its gameplay, world, and story are all very well put
        together, but still leave room for improvement, making this game the perfect series starter.

                            The
                            story begins with Mario being invited to Princess Peach's castle for a celebration of
                            the
                            Mushroom Kingdom. But then, not long after he arrives, so too does Bowser. This time, Bowser
                            brought with him a new toy; the Star Rod <img class="inline" src="Images/pm64/starrod.png"
                                alt="Star Rod">which he stole from Star Haven. It has the power
                            to grant any wish, which is
                            dangerous
                            in the hands of Bowser. After Mario loses to the sheer power of the Star Rod, Bowser
                            imprisons all the guests within the castle, as well as Princess Peach. Thus, Mario has to
                            embark on a quest to save the Star Spirits that Bowser captured, in hopes that their
                            power can be enough to overthrow Bowser and his Star Rod.

                            The battle system in this game is very simplistic, yet incredibly effective. While many
                            RPGs love to inflate the numbers to extremely high amounts (Eg. "YOU DID 13356 DMG!"), this
                            game keeps the numbers low, which I really like. It adds to the strategy of things
                            because it makes the damage and HP numbers countable, so every turn can be completely
                            calculated to your desires. <br>During your turn, you can do one of five things: Jump
                            attack, <img class="landscape jpg imageR" src="Images/pm64/battle.jpg">Hammer attack,
                            Use an
                            item,
                            Use a star
                            power, or Swap your partner. Choosing between jumping and hammering is very engaging,
                            because certain enemies are too high up to be hammered, while others can be spiky, making
                            them unable to be jumped on (without getting hurt). <br>In addition to Mario's turn, one of
                            your partner characters also get to attack. They have many unique abilities, and choosing
                            between them all and integrating them into your strategy feels very satifying.<br>This game
                            also uses action commands,
                            allowing the player to time their button presses to maximize damage, and defend against
                            enemy attacks. The implemntation of action commands in this game is flawless, they feel so
                            good to do!

                            other
                            main part of the gameplay is the overworld gameplay. This is where the game's
                            world comes to life. This game's overworld gample has multiple types of gameplay elements,
                            being
                            puzzles,
                            platforming, and exploration. The combination of all of these elements is
                            seamless, making it a joy to explore the world. <br>The puzzles are all very unique, and
                            constantly use new elements and partner abilities throughout the game. It's also very cool
                            when you unlock a new ability, and find ways to use it in areas that you've already
                            explored, making the exploration very engaging. <br>The platforming is
                            very simplistic, but I think that's what adds to the seamless nature of the overworld
                            gameplay.

                            mentioned
                            before, the badge system is what really makes this game shine in my opinion.
                            The amount to which you can tailor your gameplay style with the badges you pick is awesome!
                            Basically how it works is you have a certain number of badge points, which you
                            can allot to
                            different badges that you acquire throughout your journey. You can mix and match, swap out,
                            and add new badges to your loadout whenever you want, making it extremely flexible.
                            <br>There's three main types of badges: Move badges, Stat badges, and Helper badges.
                            <br>Move badges <img class="inline" src="Images/pm64/quakehammer.png"

                            easier action command timing, or alerts for nearby collectibles.
                            <br>With so many diverse
                            choices, and more as you go thoughout the game, this game is incredibly replayable. Each

                            with!

                            engaging and satisfying to do. His first stop on his journey is to find Eldstar, who is
                            locked up in the Koopa Bros. Fortress. Mario travels around
                            bright and
                            grassy plains of Pleasant Path, until
                            he arrives a Koopa Village, where he recruits Kooper. Mario then arrives at the fortress,
                            housing many fun puzzles and challenges throughout. It's a very fun dungeon to go through,
                            with many twists and turns. Mario also finds Bombette locked up halfway through the
                            fortress, and rescues her, <img class="boss2 png imageR" src="Images/pm64/greenkoopa.png"

                            mountain toward the desert, which is the largest area in the game. It consists of 49
                            sections, each one slightly different, and many of them housing secrets and collectibles. I
                            always explore every single section in my playthrough, however not many of them are
                            mandatory. After the desert, he arrives at a little town called Dry, Dry Outpost. Mario then
                            receives an ancient <img class="boss1 png imageR" src="Images/pm64/tutankoopa.png"
                                alt="Tutankoopa">stone from one of the townspeople that is the key to revealing the
                            secret Dry, Dry Ruins, which has resided in the desert for generations. Mario then puzzles
                            and
                            battles his way through the ruins, and eventually arrives at the end, where the boss
                            Tutankoopa awaited him. After defeating him, Mario rescues the star spirit Mamar.

                            In this chapter, Mario heads off into the spooky Forever Forest, which is very easy to
                            get
                            lost it. It has a lot of branching and circular paths, causing it to be quite the
                            puzzler to
                            get through. After this, Mario arrives at Boo's Mansion, where, after much pranking done
                            by
                            the boos, Mario meets Lady Bow. She requests his help to defeat The Invincible Tubba
                            Blubba,
                            who has been terrorizing the boos of Gusty Gulch. The task seemed insurmountable,
                            because
                            Tubba Blubba was know to be virtually invincible, but with one weakness unknown by
                            anyone.
                            Despite these odds, Mario agrees, and they set off through
                            Gusty Gulch and into Tubba Blubba's castle. This is a castle that makes you feel like
                            you're
                            in a giant's house. The ceilings are all really high, and the furniture is larger than
                            Mario
                            is! In order to make his way through the castle without alerting Tubba Blubba, Mario has
                            to
                            use Lady Bow's invisible ability to avoid triggering alarms or alerting Tubba Blubba's
                            guards. In his bedroom, Mario finds a key to a windmill that he saw earlier in Gusty
                            Gulch.
                            This key was very loud, and woke Tubba Blubba up when Mario takes it, causing him to
                            have to
                            run as fast as <img class="boss1 png imageR" src="Images/pm64/tubbablubba.png"
                                alt="Tubba Blubba">he could down to the windmill. Inside the secret windmill, Mario
                            finds Tubba
                            Blubba's weakness; his heart. Mario then battles and defeats
                            Tubba Blubba's heart, rendering<img class="boss2 png imageR" src="Images/pm64/heart.png"

                            him invincible no longer. He then finished the job and defeats Tubba
                            Blubba's castle, saving
                            the boos and freeing the star spirit Skolar.

                            Upon return from his battle with Tubba Blubba, Mario comes back to Toad Town in mayhem.
                            Shy
                            Guys have began wreaking havoc on all the townspeople and stealing their things. After
                            much
                            searching, Mario finds the source of the Shy Guys; Shy Guy's Toy Box. Without
                            hesitation,
                            Mario jumps inside to solve the next problem. Inside the Toy Box is a whole other world,
                            filled with colorful, toy-like environments. When making his way through the toy box,
                            Mario
                            recovers many of the townspeople's items, which he then needs to move
                            forward. There's a
                            cool dynamic of going back and forth between the real world and the Toy
                            Box. About halfway
                            through, Mario finds a lantern <img class="boss1 png imageR" src="Images/pm64/tank.png"
                                alt="General Guy's Tank">ghost, which, upon defeating it, reveals Watt, who then
                            joins
                            the team. Mario then makes his way to the end of the Toy Box, where the final boss,
                            General
                            Guy (I love this guy) awaits. Watt <img class="boss2 png imageR"

                            After the battle, Mario saves the star spirit, Muskular.

                            Next up on his journey, Mario embarks across the ocean to the faraway island, Lavalava
                            Island. With him on this journey is Kolorado, a famous Koopa archeologist, whom Kooper
                            idolizes heavily. Kolorado hungers for his next great treasure find. They arrive first
                            at
                            Yoshi Village, where everyone is living happily. Mario also meets Sushie, who is
                            babysitting
                            the baby Yoshis. After exploring the jumgle a bit and coming back, the baby Yohsis have
                            all
                            ran off into the jungle, causing Mario to brave the jungle after them. The jungle area
                            is
                            one of the best looking in the game, its so lush and alive. It is also a very
                            substantial
                            area to explore, with many branching paths. After rescuing the baby Yoshis, Sushie fully
                            accompanies Mario on his quest, and they, along with Kolorado, enter into the volcano.
                            With
                            Kolorado bumbling along through volcano, providing a great deal comic relief, Mario
                            encounters the most difficult enemies he has so far. I think this section is where the
                            difficulty and strategy needed takes a big step up from previous chapters.

                            just
                            as they begin to relax, the volcano begins to erupt, resulting in a fast-paced escape
                            sequence that is very thrilling, and almost sees Kolorado losing his life trying to
                            retrieve
                            a treasure
                            that he finds while escaping.

                            In my opinion this chapter is the weakest of the bunch, but it's still not bad. In this
                            one,
                            Mario heads into Flower Fields through a magical door. As opposed to all sunny and
                            lively,
                            this land is very dry and dull. This is due to clouds covering the entire sky. Mario
                            spends
                            this chapter solving the problems of various flowers of Flower Fields in order to get
                            the
                            ingredients he needs to grow a beanstalk up <img class="boss1 png imageR"
                                src="Images/pm64/huffnpuff.png" alt="Huff N. Puff">into the clouds, to find the
                            source
                            of them all.
                            On the way, Mario has a run-in with Lakilester, whom he battles first before
                            Lakilester
                            decides to join him on his heroic journey.
                            It is there that he finds the boss, Huff N. Puff, who is a truly formidable foe,
                            probably
                            the most difficult boss so far. After the fierce battle, Mario frees the star spirit,
                            Klevar.

                            As opposed to the previous chapter, this one might be my favourite of the bunch. It
                            starts
                            off with Mario arriving at Shiver City, inhabited by penguins. Not long after his
                            arrival,
                            Mario finds the mayor lying still on the floor of his room. Because of this coincidental
                            timing, Mario gets himself accused of <i>murdering</i> him! Thus Mario has to first
                            settle
                            this debacle before moving forward on his quest. Luckily, it turned out the Mayor was
                            just
                            unconscious from dropping an item on his head. With that out of the way, Mario makes his
                            way
                            to the Crystal Palace, which not only is one of the best dungeons in the game to
                            explore,
                            but it also has fantastic and atmospheric songs and visuals! This chapter is also where
                            combat is at
                            its abolute best in my opinion. Every playthrough I do, the enemies of this chapter
                            provide
                            a great challenge, but at this <img class="boss1 png imageR"
                                src="Images/pm64/crystalking.png" alt="Crystal King">point in the game you have so
                            many
                            badge points, so crafting
                            badge loadouts and seeing the work against these enemies is incredibly enjoyable.
                            After
                            making his way through this labyrinth of a castle, he comes face to face with the
                            Crystal
                            King, who is another formidable opponent. After fighting the hard fight, Mario saves the
                            final star spirit, Kalmar.

                            After recovering all the Star Spirits, Mario might finally be able to stand up against
                            Bowser and his star rod. We have seen that many of the chapters in the game conclude
                            with
                            Mario storming some kind of fortress, often housing some of the most fun puzzle-solving
                            and
                            combat challenges the game has to offer. In this chapter, Mario is storming Bowser's
                            castle
                            for the entirety of the chapter. This adds to the feeling of stakes. It truly feels like
                            everything is on the line as you slowly make your way through this gauntlet of a
                            chapter.
                            All your skills are put to the test in a spectacular fashion in combat as well
                            as using all
