        Paper Mario: Color Splash is the worst-performing game in the series. This is due to it being a direct sequel to
        Sticker Star, as well as launching on the failed console, the Wii U. Despite its sales numbers, this game is
        leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessor in more ways than one but still carries some of its problems along
        with it.

                            The story begins with Princess Peach visiting Mario's house on a stormy night with a
                            distressed look on her face. She gives Mario a letter, which, upon unravelling it, turns
                            out to be a Toad's body drained of all its colour! Though initially shocked by this, Mario
                            then realized that the toad was stamped with an address to <topic>Port Prisma</topic>. And
                            so, Mario, Peach,
                            and her Toad set sail for Port Prisma to find out what happened to this toad.

                                alt="Hammer Attack">Paper Mario: Color Splash's battle system is very similar to that of
                            Sticker Star. Mario
                            still uses disposable items as attacks, although this time they are cards instead of
                            stickers. Mario also still defaults to attacking the enemy in the front. Some subtle
                            differences are that the battle spinner is gone, and Mario can just select three cards for
                            battle no matter what. Another change is that enemies <topic>no longer have numerical
                                health</topic>, and
                            Mario doesn't do numerical damage. The enemies' health is expressed in terms of how much
                            color they have left. This takes away from some of the fun for me because I always enjoy
                            making calculated moves where I deal exactly as much damage as I expect. Whereas with the
                            lack of numbers, I find myself shooting in the dark with my moves sometimes. Also, Mario
                            gets to use his paint to <topic>paint his colourless cards</topic>
                            however much he wants. The more paint he spends on the card, the more damaging the card will
                            be. In concept, this sounds like a very engaging and strategic game of give-and-take with
                            Mario's paint, but in practice, it doesn't end up adding much strategy. Paint is so
                            plentiful that I never really felt the tradeoff when I painted my cards fully.
                            In fact, I
                            like Color Splash's battling less than Sticker Star's. I find the painting of the cards
                            really slows down the battles, making each battle feel like a slog. I never found myself
                            skipping battles in Sticker Star, but about halfway through Color Splash, I tried to avoid
                            as many as I could, simply because of how long they <img class="imageL landscape jpg"
                                src="Images/pmcs/battle.jpg" alt="Overworld">took. Color Splash tried to
                            give an
                            incentive to battle, by <img class="landscape2 imageL jpg"

                            found it to be an extremely necessary upgrade in most scenarios.

                            great improvements to.
                            Firstly, the use of the HD graphics of the Wii U really gets to shine here. The vibrancy and
                            life put into the locales in this game vs. Sticker Star is like night and day. In terms of
                            gameplay, Color Splash has its new <topic>painting mechanic</topic>. All over every level,
                            you will
                            encounter colourless patches on the floors, <img class="imageR landscape jpg"
                                src="Images/pmcs/painting.jpg" alt="Mario Painting">walls, and plants. Mario can hit
                            them with his
                            paint hammer to give them back their colour and earn some coins
                            for doing it. This is
                            extremely engaging to do and never gets old! I love going to a new level and having a
                            bunch of spots to paint. I also love that it gives the player something to do outside of the
                            main story, as each level gets a little badge next to it if the player finds and paints
                            every colourless spot. After I beat the game, I went back and painted every level! Another
                            aspect of the overworld gameplay that <img class="imageL landscape jpg"
                                src="Images/pmcs/thing.jpg" alt="Thing">isn't quite as prominent is Color Splash's
                            Paperization equivalent, called the <topic>Cutout technique</topic>. With this, Mario is
                            able to
                            temporarily cut out part of the level, and either jump on the uncut parts like a 2D
                            platformer or insert a card of his choice into it to solve a puzzle. The Cutout ability is
                            not nearly as central as Sticker Star's Paperizing, but it's still a neat mechanic that adds
                            a nice bit of variety to the gameplay. <topic>Things</topic> also <img

                            from Sticker Star, but
                            their implementation is much better in this game. There are way fewer Things than in Sticker
                            Star, making the amount of Things to choose from less overwhelming. It is also much easier
                            to tell which one is needed because of this. The game also has a hint toad that you can talk
                            to, free of charge, that tells you which Thing you will need next, making it much less
                            cumbersome to keep trying over and over until you get the right Thing.

                            However, for some reason, Color Splash's world doesn't feel as disconnected as Sticker
                            Star's did. Each level that Mario goes to feels like a continuation of the last, and they
                            fit together well to make a full-fledged chapter, instead of multiple mini-chapters. Color

                            world. I also love the touch of the map becoming more coloured in, and its music getting

                            instruments, as the game goes on. It gives you a sense of pride and accomplishment in your

                            taken by Bowser. He starts as a 3D paint bucket until he empties his paint supply to Mario
                            when Mario first learns about paint. Huey's role in the game is very similar to Kersti's

                            in Sticker Star.

                            overall just a lot nicer to be around. Huey provides Mario with the

                            Chapter 1 is a great introductory chapter that introduces you to the painting overworld
                            mechanic very well. You instantly get addicted to wanting to paint every colourless inch of
                            the levels. Mario first travels across <topic>Ruddy Road</topic>, which is a
                            red-pathed area which is very
                            vibrant and pretty, once you paint it of course. Mario then travels to
                            <topic>Cherry Lake</topic>, where he
                            solves puzzles related to water wheels, as well as learns about the Cutout technique and
                            Things. They then head to the Crimson Tower, where they believe the Red Big Paint Star is.
                            However, the drawbridge is down, and they need three special key-shaped toads <img
                                class="inline boss2" src="Images/pmcs/chosentoads.png" alt="Chosen Toads"> to help them.
                            They travel and find these toads in Cherry Lake, Bloo Bay Beach, and Daffodil Peak.
                            <topic>Bloo Bay
                                Beach</topic> is a nice and relaxing beach, and <topic>Daffodil Peak</topic> is
                            a tall mountain that
                            Mario had to
                            climb. To get to these locations, Mario explored through the cave system of the
                            Indigo Underground. After recruiting the three key toads, they unlock the bridge for Mario
                            and Huay to be able to get inside the <topic>Crimson Tower</topic>. This level isn't
                            super long, but is
                            enjoyable to make your way through. At the top, Mario finds one of Bowser's children, the
                            Koopaling, <topic>Morton</topic>. Morton wields a fire hammer, which Mario uses the Fire
                            Extinguisher Thing
                            to put out. Upon defeating Morton, Mario recovers the Red Big Paint Star. The Red Big Paint
                            star then goes off to paint a large red gate at Sunglow Ridge, <img class="boss1 imageR png"
                                src="Images/pmcs/morton.png" alt="Morton">which was previously
                            inaccessible. This is what every Big Paint Star does upon rescuing them to unlock
                            the path forward. When Mario gets back to Port Prisma, he discovers that Peach has been
                            kidnapped by Bowser now as well! Man, does she need better security or what?

                            With the gate to Sunglow Ridge coloured once again, Mario and Huey head on through.
                            <topic>Sunglow Ridge</topic> is very similar in looks to Daffodil Peak. Mario then
                            heads to a toad
                            professor's
                            house, called <topic>Ch&acirc;teau Chanterelle</topic>, but the professor is nowhere
                            to be found. Mario
                            then
                            finds him in the nearby forest, called <topic>Mondo Woods</topic>. In Mondo Woods,
                            Everything is giant,
                            which is pretty unique and fun to play through. After saving the professor, he gives Mario
                            an excavation site permit for the excavation project happening over in <topic>Marmalade
                                Valley</topic>.
                            While there, Mario gets attacked by a giant chain chomp, who turns out to be the professor's
                            pet. As thanks for finding his pet, the professor gives Mario an item that enables him to
                            get into the <topic>Kiwano Temple</topic>, which is a ruins-like area <img
                                class="boss1 imageR png" src="Images/pmcs/iggy.png" alt="Iggy">that has a lot of puzzles
                            inside.
                            After this, Mario heads to the <topic>Golden Coliseum</topic>, where he finds the
                            Koopaling, <topic>Iggy</topic>. Upon
                            defeating him by giving his chariot-carrying chain chomps a bone Thing, Mario recovers the
                            Yellow Big Paint Star, which goes and paints a massive coin in the Mondo Woods that was
                            blocking a path.

                            Now that the giant yellow coin has been painted, Mario can collect it by touching it,
                            which humorously gives him the value of only 1 coin. Through this passage, Mario makes his
                            way south, into the
                            <topic>Dark Bloo Inn</topic>, which is one of my favourite levels in the game!
                            It is
                            effectively a haunted hotel, and Mario has to solve many mysteries throughout. Certain
                            events happen at certain times, meaning Mario's investigations have to be on the clock.
                            After a certain amount of time, the hotel gets reset, and Mario starts his investigation
                            again from the beginning. This level is awesome because with every reset you get a bit
                            further in
                            putting the pieces together, and you really feel like a proper detective figuring it all
                            out. And then you have the perfect run through the hotel where everything falls into place.
                            The end result is assembling all 6 ghost toads together for a tea party. The final piece
                            that Mario needs is the teapot Thing, which he finds by going into
                            <topic>Plum Park</topic>, which is a
                            poison-filled garden.
                            Mario finds that the teapot is the source of the poison, however, upon removing it, he finds
                            <topic>Petea Piranha</topic> inside and has to defeat him first. After
                            taking the teapot
                            back to the ghosts in Dark Bloo Inn and restoring Plum Park,
                            Mario heads into the <topic>Sacred Forest</topic>, which, opposite to Mondo Woods, has
                            been shrunken, with
                            everything in it being super tiny. After the Sacred Forest, Mario makes his way to Fort
                            Cobalt, where the next Big Paint Star is held. He first has to pass the
                            entrance test at the
                            <topic>Cobalt Base</topic>, <img class="boss3 imageL png" src="Images/pmcs/peteapiranha.png"

                            With the ocean repainted by the Blue Big Paint Star, Mario and a group of sea-fairing toads
                            embark across the ocean in search of the next Big Paint Star. In the first part of the
                            chapter, Mario actually gets to control the ship and determine which directions he must go
                            to get through the <topic>Lost Sea</topic>. After that, they get caught in a whirlpool,
                            and they travel
                            to <topic>Vortex Island</topic> to put a plug in it. They then travel to <topic>Lighthouse
                                Island</topic> to shine light
                            forward deeper into the sea. Mario then arrives at <topic>Fortune Island</topic>, where the
                            next Big Pain
                            Star awaits. On all three islands Mario visits, there are pipes that lead into a parallel
                            version of all the islands, but with slight differences. This is the primary mechanic of
                            this chapter and leads to some pretty cool types of <img class="boss1 imageR png"

                            Island, Mario encounters and battles <topic>Wendy</topic> the Koopaling. Mario then receives
                            the next Big
                            Paint Star upon defeating Wendy, using the camera Thing to create a decoy of himself to
                            avoid Wendy's attacks. The Purple Big Paint Star heads off and repaints a massive Sinkhole
                            at the Mustard Café.

                            Since the sinkhole at <topic>Mustard Café</topic> was just painted in, Mario descends down
                            it to see what
                            he can find. He ends up finding the café's owner amid the sandy caverns, and also winds up
                            in snifit jail! After escaping, Mario hears that the Sunset Express is stuck at <topic>
                                Kiwano
                                Temple</topic>, and heads there right away to see what's up. It turns out the tracks
                            were broken, so
                            the train couldn't continue. After fixing the tracks, the train moves about a meter before
                            comically getting crushed by a giant thwomp out of nowhere. The passengers and crew of the
                            train then decide it's best to just puch the train to the nearest repair place, the
                            <topic>Toad Trainworks</topic>. Once there. Mario does the deed and repairs the broken
                            train, which then
                            embarks on to the <topic>Tangerino Grill</topic>, where Mario becomes a part-time chef and
                            waiter. He serves
                            pizza for all the customers and then has a mini-boss fight with a piece of steak. This
                            fight is more so trying to follow a cooking recipe to get the steak just right. This is an
                            infamous part of the game for leaving many players at a loss as to what to do because the
                            instructions aren't the clearest. After tenderizing the steak with Mario's hammer, applying
                            the lemon and salt & pepper Things, and heating the steak for just the right amount of time
                            with the grill Thing,
                            Mario serves the steak to the VIP customer. The VIP customer turns out to be none other than
                            <topic>Larry</topic> the Koopaling, who proceeds to hijack the
                            <topic>Sunset Express</topic>. Mario then<img class="boss1 imageR png"

                            Sunset Express and makes his way through to the front of the train where Larry awaits. After
                            defeating him by using the cork Thing to plug up the train's funnel pipe, Mario recovers the
                            next Big Paint Star. The Orange Big Paint Star heads off and paints the fossil that the
                            toads at the Marmelade Valley excavation site were digging up.

                            Since the Orange Big Paint Star painted the fossil in <topic>Marmalade Valley</topic>, that
                            is where Mario
                            goes next to see what has changed. Once he gets there, the fossil is completely gone. The
                            workers there said that it came back to life once it was repainted! The creature called a
                            Draggadon, headed over to the <topic>Redpepper Volcano</topic>. But when Mario tries to
                            follow it, it
                            attempts to breathe fire on him if he gets too close. In order to tame the beast, Mario
                            heads
                            back to <topic>Fort Cobalt</topic> to get a Magma Burger for the Draggadon. Once tamed,
                            Mario can ride the
                            Draggadon across the lava to get around the volcano. After some difficult battles,
                            Mairo arrives at the <topic>Redpepper Crater</topic>, which has a hot spring within it. In
                            the hot spring,
                            Mario finds a toad who works at the Tangerino Grill who says he needs something to melt a
                            big ice block at the grill. Once they find a suitable
                            option, they both head back to the <topic>Tangerino Grill</topic>. Inside the <img

                            which is useful
                            for enlarging small objects. One such object is a tiny pipe back in the

                            Inside the pipe, Mario finds and battles <topic>Kamek</topic>, who is the reason for all
                            this size-changing

                            Afterwards, this opens a path deeper into the forest,
                            eventually leading to the <topic>Green Energy Plant</topic>. Inside, Mario finds a
                            running computer. He uses the cutout technique to jump inside it, which leads to an
                            extremely cool Super Mario Bros. 3 callback, where you essentially get to play through the
                            first level of the game. You play in 2D by default but can flip the perspective to become
                            more 2.5D in gameplay. This is extremely similar to the prominent flipping mechanic in Super
                            Paper Mario. After this nostalgia trip, Mario heads even deeper into the forest, arriving at
                            the <topic>Mossrock Theatre</topic>. The Mossrock Theatre features a circus-like yet foggy
                            atmosphere, with
                            numerous juggling hammer bros. The theatre then leads straight to
                            <topic>The Emerald Circus</topic>, where
                            the final Big Paint Star is held. After performing in the circus, doing a couple small
                            minigames and battles, Mario comes <img class="boss1 imageR png" src="Images/pmcs/lemmy.png"
                                alt="Lemmy">face-to-face with the smallest of the Koopalings, <topic>Lemmy</topic>.
                            In order to attack him, Mario uses the needle Thing to pop the beach ball that he stands on.
                            He also has to use the disco ball Thing to make him dance and keep him distracted. After
                            defeating Lemmy, Mario has recovered the final Big Paint Star. The Green Big Paint Star
                            flies off to paint Luigi's go-kart.

                            Now that all 6 Big Paint Stars have been rescued, it turns out that Bowser was the one
                            behind stealing them in the first place, and used all their colours and mixed them together
                            to create the forbidden black paint, which granted him evil power and turned him into Black
                            Bowser. The 6 Paint Stars band
                            together to create a <topic>Rainbow Road</topic> up to Black Bowser's Castle. Just as the
                            rainbow gets created, Luigi rolls
                            up in his
                            newly
                            painted kart, raring to go for a drive. He takes Mario and Huey on a Mario Kart ride across
                            the Rainbow Road. Once there, Mairo and Huey go ahead and infiltrate <topic>Black
                                Bowser's Castle</topic>. Upon entering, Mario finds a picture frame of colourless Peach!
                            When he
                            goes up to
                            it, Mario falls down a pitfall and finds the final Koopaling, <topic>Roy</topic>, who
                            crashes the party and
                            battles Mario. He starts the fight by draining Mario of all his paint, and then attacks
                            using his coloured paint cannon, which hits Mario with different emotions, such as red for
                            anger or blue for sadness. When Mario gets hit, he also gains some of his paint back. Each
                            emotion has a different effect on the battle, for example, sadness makes Mario only use blue
                            cards for that turn. This battle's <img class="boss1 png imageR" src="Images/pmcs/roy.png"
                                alt="Roy">pretty fun to think on your toes in. As a
                            last-ditch effort, he fires a huge amount of black paint and
                            covers the screen. Maro has to use the washing machine Thing to clean the black
                            paint off and finish the fight.

                            After this fight, Mario finds the factory-like establishment that Bowser is using to make
                            black paint. Mario sneaks past the conveyor system by posing as a shy guy with Huey as his
                            paint bucket. He then finds a large supply of mega bob-ombs that he promptly uses to explode
                            the whole operation, causing black paint to flood everywhere. After Mario manages to escape,
                            he finds the entrance to Bowser's throne room where <topic>Black Bowser</topic> awaits.
                            Black Bowser is
                            quite intimidating-looking and has an amazing song that goes along with the fight. This
                            battle is really good because, unlike all the previous boss fights, this one doesn't rely
                            on having one specific Thing card to get the job done, all you have are your best cards and
                            your strategy to determine when to use them. After phase 1, Black Bowser grows in size and
                            intensity and begins regenerating all the black paint that Mario just spent so long
                            knocking off. Much like Sticker Star's finale, Huey chooses to turn into a card for Mario
                            to use. Huey then becomes his 3D-self that he was at the beginning of the game. Mario then
                            uses him as a shield/absorber of Black Bowser's attacks, so that Bowser can't regenerate the
                            black paint used in his attacks. This part of the fight is very cool because the intensity
                            that you feel every time a big attack is coming in, and you have to block it perfectly, is a
                            very cool feeling. After a while, Huey starts to hit his capacity of how much black paint he
                            can take, but he pushes through and eventually <img class="boss4 imageR png"
                                src="Images/pmcs/blackbowser.png" alt="Black Bowser">absorbs all of Bowser's black
                            paint,
                            restoring him to his usual, less-sinister self, who has no memory of what happened. Mario
                            then restores Princess Peach's colours
                            after the fight, and Mario, Peach, and Luigi head back down the Rainbow Road, with Huey
                            choosing to stay back to release all the black paint out of harm's way. When he does, the
                            castle explodes, and Huey is never seen by Mario again. Unlike Kersti's sacrifice, this
                            one's actually pretty emotional because Huey was an incredibly enjoyable character and
                            companion throughout the adventure.
