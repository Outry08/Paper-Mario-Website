        Paper Mario: Sticker Star is where the series fell off for a LOT of people. It is often criticized for its lack
        of experience points for battling, the lack of interesting characters, and the lack of a compelling story. The
        game is for sure not as good as the others in the series in my opinion, but it does have its good parts too.

                            The story begins on the night of the annual <topic>Sticker Fest</topic>, which celebrates
                            the yearly
                            passing of the Sticker Comet. The Sticker Comet is said to be able to grant people's wishes.
                            Once the Sticker Comet comes around, Bowser crashes the festival and tries to take the
                            Sticker Comet for himself. The second he touches it, the Sticker Comet gets split into 6
                            Royal Stickers, which are each in the shape of a crown. One of the Royal Stickers lands on
                            Bowser's head, granting him immense sticker power, which he then uses to wreck the Sticker
                            Festival after Mario tries and fails to stop him.

                            battle system in Paper Mario: Sticker Star harkens back to the original two games in
                            some ways while putting its own spin on things as well. First off, the combat is back to
                            being turn-based instead of real-time like in Super Paper Mario. The first major difference
                            is that, in order for Mario to attack, he needs to use <topic>disposable stickers</topic> he
                            picks up in
                            the overworld. The sticker you choose determines what move you do. Once you use up a
                            sticker, it is gone. This can add an element of risk and reward, as you tend to save your
                            more powerful stickers for just the right moment, and you may have to change up your go-to
                            strategy if you don't have the sticker in mind. There are quite a few mechanics that Sticker
                            Star has removed from its predecessors' battle systems. The most prominent of these is the
                            <topic>lack of experience points</topic> earned when defeating enemies in battle. This led
                            to a lot of
                            complaints from fans, as there is now little to no incentive to go out of your way to
                            battle. On top of that, the only thing that really comes out of battling is wasting
                            stickers. Another big removal is the <topic>lack of the ability to choose an enemy</topic>
                            to target. Mario
                            will always default to attacking the first enemy in line. This removes quite a bit of
                            strategy that made the previous games' battle systems so fun and engaging. The third and
                            final major removal from the battle system is the <topic>lack of partners</topic> to fight
                            by your side.
                            Mario only has one partner throughout the whole game, and she does not participate in
                            battle. This also removes quite a bit of strategy and engagement and decreases the
                            variability that the player can have in their approach to battling.<br><br>
                            Despite this, personally, when I play the game, I quite enjoy the battle system for what it
                            is. Having to think on your feet based on <img class="imageR landscape jpg"
                                src="Images/pmss/battlejump.jpg" alt="Jump attack">what stickers you have available can
                            be a fun
                            challenge to do in every battle. I also find myself incentivized to battle <i>because</i>
                            it
                            spends my stickers. One of my favourite parts of this game is collecting the massive amount
                            of stickers you can find all over the world. But eventually, my stickerbook gets too
                            full and I have to ignore a bunch of stickers that I pass. Battling helps me maintain a
                            steady inflow and outflow of stickers, keeping me engaged in both aspects of the gameplay.

                            <img class="imageR landscape jpg" src="Images/pmss/overworld.jpg" alt="Overworld">As with
                            the battle system, the overworld gameplay is more similar to that of Paper Mario 64
                            and <abbr title="Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door">TTYD</abbr>, taking a more 2.5D
                            perspective, instead of being a pure 2D platformer like Super Paper Mario. Similar to the
                            first two games, there is a healthy combination of enemies to fight, puzzles to solve, and
                            a bit of platforming thrown in as well. The main new activity, as I mentioned, is
                            <topic>picking up stickers</topic> that are scattered all over the place. I find this keeps
                            me very
                            engaged in the
                            overworld gameplay, and I always get a rush of excitement when I see a sticker I haven't
                            seen before. In addition to <img class="imageL landscape jpg" src="Images/pmss/paperize.jpg"
                                alt="Paperizing">stickers, Mario can occasionally come across real-world objects,
                            like scissors for example, called <topic>Things</topic>. Mario can convert these Things into
                            stickers,
                            which can then be used in either combat as a super-powerful move, or in
                            the overworld to
                            solve puzzles. To use stickers in the overworld, Mario's partner, Kersti, grants him the
                            ability to Paperize. <topic>Paperizing</topic> involves Mario leaving the world, and looking
                            at it like a
                            storybook. Once here, Mario can stick stickers onto the world just as one could do to a
                            real-life storybook. The ability to paperize gives the game a lot of
                            creative freedom with
                            solutions to puzzles, sometimes allowing for more than one solution to a given problem.
                            More<img class="imageR landscape2 jpg" src="Images/pmss/thing.jpg" alt="Thing">
                            often than not though, Mario requires one specific Thing sticker to get the job done. While
                            it can be satisfying to guess the right sticker, more often than not it can
                            get
                            frustrating. The main reason is that after guessing wrong when paperizing, the sticker gets
                            wasted anyways. This can lead to a ton of unwanted back-and-forth gameplay that could have
                            otherwise been avoided.

                            One major change from the previous three Paper Mario games that Sticker Star makes is the
                            addition of a world map, as opposed to one large interconnected world. Each
                            chapter is
                            comprised of <topic>multiple levels</topic>, connected solely by this world map. This was
                            most likely done
                            to accommodate the handheld platform that this game was on, but it can lead to breaks in
                            immersion. It is very cool to be able <img class="imageR landscape jpg"
                                src="Images/pmss/worldmap.jpg" alt="World Map">to travel seamlessly across the world in
                            the first
                            three games. Having the world map isn't deal-breaking, but it makes the chapters
                            feel more
                            disjointed and less like one single environment. One thing that I <i>do</i> like about it is
                            that it makes backtracking easier, and less of a hassle. Sometimes the game uses this to its
                            benefit, utilizing levels multiple times for various purposes like retrieving items or going
                            through a path that you could not before.

                            Kersti is the guardian of the sticker comet. She was sent to help secure the Royal Stickers
                            by the Sticker Comet just before Bowser touched it. When Mario first finds her, it becomes
                            instantly clear that she's a bit of a hothead. Without warning, she just starts yelling at
                            Mario, assuming he was the one who touched the comet. After he explains what actually
                            happened, she
                            calms
                            down and agrees to join him on his journey. She is honestly not the most likable partner in
                            the world. She loses her temper easily and is overall just not pleasant to be honest. She
                            provides Mario the ability to <topic>paperize</topic> in the overworld. In battle, she gives
                            him the
                            <topic>battle spinner</topic>, which Mario can pay coins to use. If he is lucky with the

                            he gains

                            has been completely destroyed, and Princess Peach is missing! Pretty much as soon as Mario

                            who yells at him and then joins him. The first thing Mario notices is that there are toads
                            scattered about all over the place. So, Mario takes it upon himself to find and rescue all
                            the toads, who then work together to unravel the main town of the game,
                            <topic>Decalburg</topic>. Mario
                            then battles three goombas within Decalburg, which teaches him about the battle system.

                            This chapter is all about exploring the grassy lands called the
                            <topic>Warm Fuzzy Plains</topic>. The first
                            two levels are spent going through this area, saving toads, battling goombas, and getting a
                            whole bunch of stickers. In the first level, Mario fights Bowser Jr.<img
                                class="inline boss2" src="Images/pmss/bowserjr.png" alt="Bowser Jr."> He defeats him by
                            using
                            the scissors Thing sticker. Level 3 takes Mario back to his plumbing roots and requires him
                            to use a faucet Thing sticker to fix a <topic>broken pipe system</topic>. Mario then scales
                            a
                            grassy mountain,
                            called <topic>Whammino Mountain</topic>, in Level 5, which is a very fun level with lots of
                            verticality.
                            And then finally, Level 6 takes Mario to the <topic>Goomba Fortress</topic>. The fortress is
                            not terribly
                            long, but is fun to puzzle your way through nonetheless, and is much more interesting than
                            the standard grassy plain levels. When Mario reaches the end of the fortress, he encounters
                            the <topic>Megasparkle Goomba</topic>, who has <img class="imageR boss1 png"
                                src="Images/pmss/megasparklegoomba.png" alt="Megasparkle Goomba">the first Royal
                            Sticker. If you are not
                            familiar with using Thing stickers in battle, this one can be quite a challenging first
                            boss, as the game intends for you to use Thing stickers to blast his health away, but this
                            is not always clear. After defeating the Megasparkle Goomba, Mario recovers the first Royal
                            Sticker and concludes the chapter.

                            As you may have guessed, Chapter 2 takes place exclusively in a desert, called
                            <topic>Drybake Desert</topic>. Throughout each level, Mario has to solve tricky puzzles to
                            obtain
                            pieces of the
                            last level in order to paperize and construct the final level and then beat it. Level 1 is
                            just spent traversing the sandy dunes and fighting sand-related enemies
                            like Pokeys and Spinies. Level 2 is a very good level where you get to explore the
                            <topic>Yoshi Sphinx</topic>. It's a very fun area to explore, with many branching paths
                            leading to
                            secret areas.
                            At the top of the Yoshi Sphinx, Mario encounters <topic>Kamek</topic>,<img
                                class="inline boss2" src="Images/pmss/kamek.png" alt="Kamek">who is a recurring miniboss
                            in this
                            game where he transforms all of Mario's stickers into flip-flops. These boss fights are
                            tricky because you have to remember where your not-so-good stickers are so that you do not
                            end up wasting a really good sticker while it was transformed into a weak flip-flop. After
                            this, Level 3 takes Mario to an underground ruin called the
                            <topic>Sandshifter Ruins</topic>. The ruins are
                            effectively a glorified pachinko machine, where Mario has to choose different places to jump
                            down to reach different areas. It can be a <img class="boss4 imageR png"
                                src="Images/pmss/towerpowerpokey.png" alt="Tower Power Pokey">bit tedious to travel
                            through, but not too bad.
                            Level 4 takes Mario to a dried-out oasis, called the <topic>Damp Oasis</topic>. It is
                            currently enveloped
                            in a powerful vortex, which Mario uses the vaccuum Thing sticker to clean up, and then the
                            faucet Thing sticker to refill the oasis. Finally, after collecting all the pieces of the
                            level, Level 5 sees Mario climbing to the top of the <topic>Drybake Stadium</topic>. The
                            Drybake Statium is
                            a multi-level, puzzle-based dungeon in which Mario has to solve many puzzles to do with
                            paperizing. After reaching the top, Mario finds the <topic>Tower Power Pokey</topic>. The
                            key to defeating
                            this one is using the baseball bat Thing sticker to hit each of its sections away, dealing
                            massive damage to it.

                            Chapter 3 takes place inside a lush dank forest, called <topic>The Bafflewood</topic>. It
                            begins with Mario
                            meeting a very friendly Wiggler.<img class="inline boss2" src="Images/pmss/wiggler.png"
                                alt="Wiggler"> Soon after, Wiggler gets split apart by Kamek's magic,
                            causing each of his segments to run away into various parts of the forest. Mario is thus
                            tasked with tracking down each <topic>Wiggler segment</topic> and return them to Wiggler.
                            This chapter is
                            incredibly long, as every time Mario finds a segment, they run off a second time, forcing
                            Mario to find each of them a second time, which becomes very tedious. Some standout levels
                            are Levels 7 and 10. In Level 7, Mario falls down a large hole, into the gave called
                            <topic>Rustle Burrow</topic>, and drops all of his
                            belongings, including his hammer, stickers, and Kersti herself. The stickers you had get
                            scattered all across the cave, and Mario spends the level finding them all. This level is
                            very cool because you start from nothing, struggling through every battle, and then by the
                            end, after getting all your stickers back, you feel extremely powerful in comparison to how
                            you first were. Level 10 is iconic because in it Mario participates in the game show,
                            <topic>Snifit or Whiffit</topic>. This is a very fun part of the game, and very memorable
                            for its humour. It can
                            also be a fun challenge. After finding all of Wiggler's segments, Mario rides on him
                            across the sea to find the source of the poison that had <img class="boss3 imageR png"
                                src="Images/pmss/gooperblooper.png" alt="Gooper Blooper">been infecting the waters of
                            the
                            forest. Once there, Mario finds out that the source of the poison was the
                            <topic>Gooper Blooper</topic>,
                            who had the next Royal Sticker. This boss is actually impossible if you do
                            not have the Thing sticker that is required for it, being the sponge. The sponge is used to
                            defend Mario from an incoming poison shot from the Gooper Blooper. Once defeated, the Gooper
                            Blooper drops the Royal Sticker, and Mario recovers it.

                            Chapter 4 is themed around snow. In addition to that, within the snowy levels, you begin to
                            encounter shiny stickers in the overworld, which are more powerful versions of the stickers
                            you get before this area. Some of the enemies you encounter are also shiny. Thus, this is
                            the chapter where things step up in difficulty a little bit, with both stronger enemies to
                            face and stronger stickers to use. Level 1, taking place in the <topic>Snow Rise</topic>, is
                            enjoyable to play through
                            for this reason. It's cool to feel a sense of levelling up in your adventure, albeit a small
                            one. Then, after Level 2, which is another fairly standard
                            snow level, we arrive at Level 3, <topic>The Enigmansion</topic>. The Enigmansion might just
                            be the best
                            level in the game. Basically, you explore this large mansion effectively becoming a
                            ghostbuster. You have to hunt down every last Boo in the mansion, which is extremely fun to
                            do. Some of them are pretty well hidden too! There's one moment where you get to use the
                            infini-jump <img class="inline" src="Images/pmss/infinijump.jpg" alt="Infinijump"> sticker
                            on
                            a massive stack of boos, which lets you do as many jumps as you can
                            time correctly, with no limit! It's super fun to do. After this level, we have a level
                            that's more of a minigame, where Mario rides a <img class="boss4 imageR png"
                                src="Images/pmss/snowbowser.png" alt="Snow Bowser">ski-lift in
                            <topic>Whiteout Valley</topic> to go
                            further up the mountain.
                            It's not a
                            long level, but is fun for what it is. And finally, Mario arrives at Level 6, which is
                            <topic>Bowser's Snow Fort</topic>. This level begins with Mario waiting patiently in line to
                            go on a
                            minecart ride. Then, the minecart ride itself is something straight out of Donkey Kong,
                            having you timing jumps to clear gaps, as well as <img class="boss1 imageR png"

                            After the minecart ride, Mario starts getting attacked by this giant snow sculpture of
                            Bowser. As Mario battles it, he starts to reveal who is controlling it, being
                            <topic>Mizzter Blizzard</topic> the Snowman. After defeating him, Mario retrieves the next
                            Royal Sticker from him,
                            ending the chapter.

                            Up next is Chapter 5, which takes Mario to a jungle-themed chapter. He begins with Level 1,
                            in the <topic>Shy Guy Jungle</topic>. It's a fairly long level where Mario has to chase down
                            three Spear
                            Guys who have stolen pieces of the bridge forward. After this, Mario spends the next two
                            levels river-rafting down the <topic>Jungle Rapids</topic>. In Level 3 specifically, Mario
                            gets chased down
                            by a giant Cheep-Chomp. After this, Mario arrives at the <topic>Chomp Ruins</topic> in Level
                            4, which is
                            another one of my favourite levels of the game. The battles that take place in this level
                            are some of the best, and the ruins themselves <img class="boss3 imageR png"
                                src="Images/pmss/peteypiranha.png" alt="Petey Piranha">are a joy to play through. In the
                            final two
                            levels, Mario hot-foots it into the <topic>Rumble Volcano</topic>, which is a dangerous
                            place filled
                            with
                            tough enemies and tough puzzles. I got stuck in the Rumble Volcano for a while on my first
                            playthrough. Once you reach the end, Mario finds one of his oldest nemeses,
                            <topic>Petey Piranha</topic>,
                            who has the fifth Royal Sticker. After defeating Petey Piranha, Mario secures the next Royal
                            Sticker, ending the chapter.

                            Chapter 6 is the finale of the game. We only have two levels, and they aren't overly long.
                            There's no big huge final dungeon, which is a bit of a shame. Instead, Level 1 takes us
                            aboard <topic>Bowser Jr's Fiery Flotilla</topic>, which is his airship. Mario gets help from
                            the Wiggler
                            from Chapter 3, who has now transformed into a Flutter (a Wiggler butterfly).<img

                            Mario does some battling and puzzling and then battles Bowser Jr. one last time. After
                            this, Mario heads into <topic>Bowser's Sky Castle</topic> to face Bowser and recover the
                            final Royal
                            Sticker once and for all. But before he does, Mario battles Kamek one last time as well,
                            with his stickers being temporarily turned into flip-flops again too. After this, Mario
                            jumps straight into the fight with <topic>Bowser</topic>, with very little buildup. Fighting
                            him can be
                            quite frustrating as well to be honest. Where every boss has required one Thing sticker
                            to be the solution to it Bowser has multiple phases, each with their own Thing sticker
                            solution. Your skills and sticker management don't really feel like they come into play
                            until
                            the final phase when Bowser grows giant. This portion of the fight is quite enjoyable and
                            makes me wish more of the fight was as good. Partway through this phase, Kersti decides to
                            <topic>sacrifice</topic> herself to give Mario an extra boost in sticker power so that he
