        Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door is regarded by many to be the greatest game in the series. From its
        extremely distinct personalities and locations, to its grand and investing story, to its tight and engaging
        gameplay, this game leaves very little room for improvement.

                            The game opens with Princess Peach, on a royal trip, takes a stop at the not-so-inviting
                            town of Rogueport. Rogueport is home to many criminals and lower-class individuals, which
                            becomes apparent the second you arrive there. While there,
                            Princess Peach gets given a
                            mysterious treasure, and writes a letter to Mario, with a mysterious treasure map attatched.
                            Peach invited Mario to come meet her so they can have a look at what it may mean.
                            However, by the time Mairo arrives, the Princess is missing! It is up to Mario to slowly
                            piece together what happened, and save Princess Peach from whoever took her.

                            The battle system of this game has the same root mechanics as its predecessor, while
                            introducing many new ones as well that freshen things up. One major difference is that
                            <topic>Mario's partners</topic> have their own health, and can now also be targeted by
                            enemies when they
                            attack. This adds a new layer of strategy, allowing allies to take hits that Mario would
                            otherwise have to endure, and it also gives the partners a sense of impermanence in battle.
                            Mario's partners can also use items and badges just like Mario could in the previous game,
                            making partners a lot more versatile in what they can do. <br>Another big change is that
                            <topic>enemies can use items and badges</topic>, adding a new element of unpredictability
                            that was
                            not seen in Paper Mario 64. Sometimes these items <img class="imageR jpg landscape"
                                src="Images/pmttyd/stylish.gif" alt="Stylish Move">can really give you a run for your
                            money.
                            <br>The third major addition to combat is <topic><img class="inline"
                                    src="Images/pmttyd/stylish.png" alt="Stylish"> moves</topic>.
                            While these do nothing to deal
                            more
                            damage to the opponent, not only are they fun to pull of and discover, but they provide
                            extra star power, allowing you to execute star moves more frequently. Nearly every
                            move has
                            a stylish timing that you can discover by simply pressing <img class="inline"
                                src="Images/pmttyd/Abutton.png" alt="A">
                            at the right time. They are extremely<img class="imageL jpg landscape"
                                src="Images/pmttyd/superguard.jpg" alt="Mario Superguarding">
                            satisfying and fun to pull off, adding even more engagement to
                            the battle system. <br>And
                            finally, <abbr title="The Thousand Year Door">TTYD</abbr> introduces a new defensive move
                            that you can do with really precise timing, the <topic>Superguard</topic>. This move is
                            effectively a
                            counterattack, negating all incoming damage, and in turn dealing one damage back to the
                            attacker. While this is extremely satisfying to pull of, I find that if you really get the
                            timing down, it takes away a lot of the challenge that the game would otherwise have if you
                            could only defend.

                            The overworld gameplay of Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door is also very iterative upon
                            its
                            predecessor. Because of the upgraded power from the N64 to the Gamecube, <abbr

                            elements on top of Mario and his partners' overworld abilities. Throughout the game, Mario

                            adds onto its predecessor is the amount of side content the player gets to do. For one, in
                            Rogueport, there's an entire quest board, called the <topic>Trouble Center</topic>, taking
                            the player all
                            across the game for them to solve all sorts of problems and get useful rewards for doing
                            them. This adds to the game a whole lot
                            moer to do, and also really fleshes out the world in which you are exploring. You can even
                            get an entirely optional extra party member for doing a certain quest! <br>Another big
                            piece of side content is the <topic>Pit of 100 Trials</topic>, which I absolutely love.
                            Effectively, it is
                            a gauntlet of pure battling through 100 descending floors. The enemies get more difficult as
                            you go, and it can become an extreme challenge very quickly. This is especially so because
                            you don't have any way of re-stocking on items as you go. Once you go down into the pit,
                            there's no pausing and coming back later, you either keep <img class="imageR jpg landscape"
                                src="Images/pmttyd/pitof100trials.jpg" alt="Pit Of 100 Trials">going, or exit and
                            restart from
                            floor 1 later. There's also a very tough final boss awaiting you at floor 100, amounting to
                            the ultimate test after you have already endured 99 floors of pure fighting. You also get
                            rewarded with very useful badges every 10 floors, making the trips down feel very
                            fulfilling. My favourite way to tackle the pit is going another 10 floors each chapter,
                            allowing me to reap the rewards of the badges through my playthrough as well as go to the
                            floor that I believe matches the limit of my current strength.

                            folks.
                            Regardless, it will later be revealed that they are the big bads of the game, and are
                            responsible for taking Princess Peach! After this run-in with the X-Nauts, Goombella
                            takes

                            in history.
                            Mario
                            consults him about his treasure map that Peach sent him, and Frankly tells him that it
                            is a
                            legendary treasure map that guides him to the Crystal Stars, which are very magical and
                            powerful objects sealed away long ago. It is said that these crystal stars can be
                            used to
                            open the 1000 year door and find the fabled legendary treasure within. With that in

                            Mario embarks on his newest adventure to find and secure the seven Crystal Stars

                            Being the first chapter of the game, it does an incredibly good job of setting the tone of
                            adventure and excitement. From the music to the visuals, you can tell right away that this
                            journey will be a special one. The first area, <topic>Petal Meadows</topic>, is similar in
                            nature to
                            Pleasant Path of Paper Mario 64, very introductory and grassy, but that's not a bad thing.
                            This chapter serves as a great introduction into overworld and battle mechanics. Once Mario
                            arrives at the local town, <topic>PetalBurg</topic>, it's there he discovers that it's being
                            terrorized by
                            a dragon that lives nearby. Mario takes it upon himself to help the village and defeat the
                            dragon. But before he does, Koops stops him and begs Mario to let him join. Mario of course
                            agrees, and they set off <img class="boss4 png imageR" src="Images/pmttyd/hooktail.png"

                            bones roam,
                            showing all the koopas who had fallen
                            before. This castle consists of a lot of puzzles to do
                            with Koops' abilities, and it's a very fun one to make your way through, with many secrets
                            dotted about as well. Halfway through the castle, Mario received his second "curse" from the
                            black chest ghost, allowing him to flip sideways. At the top, Mario faces
                            <topic>Hooktail</topic> the
                            dragon in a very dynamic and grand-scoped boss fight. It really signifies the step-up in
                            ambition and power that this game has over its predecessor. After defeating Hooktail, Mario
                            obtains his first crystal star.

                            The next chapter takes place in <topic>Boggly Woods</topic>. It's a very visually unique
                            location that has
                            a lot of black and white environments in it. Mario came here because a Puni <img
                                class="inlineTop" src="Images/pmttyd/punio.png" alt="Punio the Puni">, one the
                            residents of The Great Boggly Tree, called for Mario's aid. Their tree is being held hostage
                            by the
                            X-Nauts. On the
                            way, Mario encounters Madame Flurrie, whom it a friend to the punies, and leaps to their aid
                            when she hears that they're in danger. Afterwards, Mario also runs into the Shadow Sirens
                            <img class="inline boss2" src="Images/pmttyd/shadowsirens.png" alt="Shadow Sirens">
                            for the first time, who are three phantom sisters who love to cause trouble. Inside
                            <topic>The Great Tree</topic>, Mario finds it crawling with X-Nauts, and gets the feeling it
                            has
                            something to do with
                            them searching to find the next crystal star. Eventually, Mario finds a way to free all 100
                            punies from their captivity, and he rallies them all to help him find the crystal star
                            first. Herding all the punies can be challenging and finicky, but they are required for many
                            puzzles within the tree. After travelling through the whole tree, Mario gets duped by Lord
                            Crump of the X-Nauts, who steals the crystal <img class="imageR png boss3"
                                src="Images/pmttyd/magnus.png" alt="Magnus Von Grapple">star right out from under their
                            noses, and
                            makes a break for it. Luckily, Mario is able to catch up to him, and go head to head with
                            him for the crystal star. However, Lord Crump came equipped with a high-tech mech suit
                            called <topic>Magnus Von Grapple</topic>. Despite this, when Mario emerges triumphant, he
                            recovers the
                            crystal star and sends the X-Nauts away from the tree. This chapter is the moment we
                            discover that the X-Nauts will be a constant threat in our quest for the crystal stars.

                            Up next is one of my personal favourites. Mario's map takes him next to the town in the sky,
                            Glitzville. <topic>Glitzville</topic> is a
                            place whose culture is all encompassed by gladiator matches in the arena called the Glitz
                            Pit. When Mario arrives, one
                            of the first things he sees is the champion, Rawk Hawk, with his champion's belt. And what
                            else would be on it, but the
                            next crystal star. From there Mario's objective was clear: Climb the gladiator ladder and
                            become the ultimate champion
                            to win the crystal star. So yes, a lot of the gameplay of this chapter is battles, however
                            they are more unique than
                            regular enemies you'd find out in the field, making them feel a bit more special. Bowser
                            even crashes the party at one
                            point! And battling's already so darn fun that it's not even a problem. Where the real meat
                            of the chapter comes from is
                            everything that happens between battles. For one, Mario hatches Yohsi's egg. Also, more and
                            more Mario starts getting <topic>cryptic messages</topic>
                            asking him to go places.
                            After a while it becomes clear that something was amiss about the whole place. There's been
                            conspiracies of fighters
                            that went missing, and as the chapter goes on, Mario ends up proving these conspiracies
                            true. The mystery and suspense
                            of this chapter is truly awesome and I can't do it justice just by writing about it here.

                            fake! Not long after, Mario finds incriminating evidence of the Glitz Pit's manager and

                            confronts him about this, it is revealed that Grubba had been using the crystal star to suck

                            crystal star to become Macho
                            Grubba, in hopes of defeating Mario. After an intense fight, Mario emerges victorious and
                            recovers the crystal star.

                            Chapter 4 is a lot of people's favourite chapter. It comes with a very cool and creepy area,
                            as well as a very cool sub-plot. Mario's map takes him to the dark and depressing town of
                            <topic>Twilight Town</topic>. This place has an eerie sense about it, making you feel
                            slightly uneasy as
                            you go through it. The town's inhabitants don't help either. They're mostly friendly, but
                            they also add the the eerie feeling of the place. Shortly after Mario arrives, he encounters
                            a problem. People are sporadically turning into pigs! Every time the town bell tolls,
                            another townsperson is randomly selected to become a pig. Mario goes to confront the source
                            in the nearby <topic>Creepy Steeple</topic>, which is a big and creepy mansion. Inside the
                            Creepy Steeple,
                            Mario receives his next "curse", giving him the ability to roll up into a tube and roll
                            under small gaps. Not long after arriving, Mario
                            encounters the troublemaker, <topic>Doopliss</topic>, who's responsible for turning the town
                            into pigs,
                            simply for his amusement. Mario battles Doopliss, finding out that he is capable of
                            shape-shifting. He copies Mario when they fight, but Mario ends up winning surprisingly
                            easily. Or so he thought. Doopliss had one more trick up his sleeve, he changed bodies with
                            Mario! Now all his partners think they've just won with Mario and are off to the next place,
                            but Mario gets left behind, as a shadow of his former self. <img class="inline boss2"

                            feeling at a loss as to what to do. But on the way he finds <topic>Vivian</topic>, who is
                            sad because of
                            being picked on by her sisters again. When Mario decides to cheer her up, she decides to
                            help him get his body back, not knowing he's actually Mario. Together, they confront
                            Doopliss again, this time having to fight him as Mario with all our partners.

                            This next chapter is very thematic to pirates. It begins with Mario recruiting Admiral
                            Bobbery to help him sail across the sea to the next crystal star location, <topic>Keelhaul
                                Key</topic>. As
                            part of their pirate crew, unbeknownst to Mario, was Lord Crump in disguise.
                            While on their way, their ship gets attacked by a large number of fire ghosts,
                            causing their ship to sink. Mario and co. then wake up on the shore of the island. After
                            exploring the lush island, Mario heads inside the mountain of the island, <topic>Pirate's
                                Grotto</topic>.
                            Inside Pirate's Grotto, Mario receives his fourth and final "curse", the paper boat
                            transformation, which is used heavily in this area. Exploring Pirate's Grotto is one of the
                            most enjoyable areas in the game I think. Once thay reach the end, Mario encounters
                            <topic>Cortez</topic>,
                            who is a legendary ghost pirate who has been residing here for a very long time. His boss
                            fight can be quite challenging if you aren't <img class="imageR boss3 png"

                            him, he actually decides to aid Mario, and willing gives his crystal star to him.
                            However,
                            just when they thought everything was done, Lord Crump ditches his disguise and launches an
                            all out X-Naut attack with their X-Naut battleship. In retaliation, Mario and Cortez use his
                            ship to go head to head with Crump and his X-Nauts in an epic clash. Mario, once again,
                            triumphs over Lord Crump, and he flees yet again.

                            This chapter is a bit different to provious ones. It sees Mario and Co. riding a train, the
                            <topic>Excess Express</topic>, for 3 days in order to get to Poshley Heights, where the next
                            crystal star
                            is. Because the entire chapter takes place on the train, there's little combat this time
                            around, which some fans don't like as much, but I think it provides a good change of pace.
                            Instead of battling, you get to know all the other characters riding the train, and even get
                            to solve some train mysteries as well. Halfway through, the train makes a stop at the
                            <topic>Riverside Station</topic> to refuel. It is here where the more classic Paper Mario
                            gameplay comes
                            back for a brief intermission. Battles and puzzles take place here, and Mario encounters
                            wierd creatures called the <topic>Smorgs</topic>, but beats them relatively <img
                                class="imageR boss3 png" src="Images/pmttyd/smorgs.png" alt="Smorgs">easily. However, a
                            short time
                            after the train embarks again, it's revealed that the Smorgs had borded the train, and
                            began
                            multiplying in numbers, eventually engulfing the whole train. Mario has to climb onto the
                            roof of the train to put a stop to them. After that, the train arrives at <topic>Poshley
                                Heights</topic>,
                            which, as the name implies, is a very prestigious place where rich people live. You even run
                            into Lady Bow there! It is there
                            that Mario retrieves the crystal star.

                            Now is time for the imfamous Chapter 7, within it having some of the highest highs of the
                            game, as well as possibly the lowest low. The chapter begins with Mario finding out that the
                            final crystal star is on the Moon. In order to get there, he confides in the bob-ombs of
                            <topic>Fahr Outpost</topic> to shoot him to the Moon out of a giant cannon. However, they
                            need a special
                            key that only the bob-omb named General White <img class="inline boss2"
                                src="Images/pmttyd/generalwhite.jpg" alt="General White"> has, but it seems he is
                            missing. To find him,
                            the game sends you on a wild goose chase to almost all the locations you've already
                            explored, making for a very cumbersome and tedious task that many fans call the worst part
                            of the game, myself included.
                            After we find General White, the
                            bob-ombs explode the cannon
                            in a spectacular fashion, hurdling Mario toward the Moon.

                            the <topic>X-Naut Fortress</topic>. This is where their base of operations has been the
                            whole time, and
                            this must mean thay have the last crystal star already. Mario heads inside the fortress with
                            no hesitaion, into one of the best areas of the game. Not only is it a very cool feeling
                            infiltrating the enemy's main base, but it also has an incredibly good song to go along with
                            it. After making his way through the fortress, not letting anyone stand in his way, Mario
                            encounters, yet again, Lord Crump. This time, he is equipped with an upgraded version of his
                            mech, <topic>Magnus Von Grapple 2.0</topic>. <img class="boss3 imageR png"

                            Grapple's previous iteration. Once defeated, Lord Crump drops the crystal star and Mario
                            retrieves it. But, Mario thought he would also be able to find Peach here, but she has
                            already been taken away from the main base by the X-Naut higher in status than Lord Crump.
                            Mario then learns that Peach has been taken to the Palace of Shadow, which is the realm
                            beyond the Thousand Year Door. The chapter ends as Mario sets off for the door posthaste.

                            The final chapter of the game is one that ties the story up very nicely. The legendary
                            <topic>Palace of Shadow</topic> beyond The Thousand Year Door adds so much mystery, lore,
                            and intrigue to
                            this game's story. I absolutely love whenever stories incorporate legendary locations that
                            were significant so long ago, and having the protagonist find them millenia later. This game
                            does it extremely well. From the moment you walk inside the door, all you can feel is
                            intrigue and wonder as to what events occured in this place. The atmosphere is dark,
                            abondoned, and eminates a sense of <i>"we shouldn't be here."</i> Also as you make your way
                            through, you encounter enemies that are other-worldly and very strong, only adding to that
                            forboding feeling. The atmosphere of this place is even cooler because it's in a Mario game.
                            Mario game's aren't known for deep stories or unhappy locations, so it's very cool to see
                            this game break conventions and <img class="imageL boss4 png"
                                src="Images/pmttyd/gloomtail.png" alt="Gloomtail">try
                            something new with Mario. Much
                            like the final chapter of
                            Paper Mario 64, this entire chapter is one big dungeon-like journey, making it super
                            engaging and fun to explore the entire labyrinth. Also adding to the fear factor of this
                            place, the further and deeper you go in, the more it begins to feel like <i>"How am I ever
                                going to get back out?"</i> because it is such a large place. Eventually, Mario
                            encounters a dragon, who has resided in the Palace of Shadows for who knows how long! It
                            turns out this dragon is the sibling of Hooktail, called <topic>Gloomtail</topic>. This
                            fight is a very
                            challenging one, but once you defeat Gloomtail, the way forward is unveiled.

                            At the
                            very end
                            of the dungeon, Mario runs into the leader of the X-Nauts, <topic>Grodus</topic>, who has
                            Princess Peach
                            with him. Grodus is truly powerful, but always sounds very calm, making him feel very
                            intimidating when fighting him. Despite this, Mario emerges triumphant, but Grodus runs
                            along ahead with Peach, taking her to a sort of altar. He then uses Peach as an offering to
                            the demon, the <topic>Shadow Queen</topic>, who is an uber-powerful being who had been
                            sealed away in the
                            Palace of Shadow 1000 years ago. The Shodow Queen posseses Peach, using her as a host.
                            And when Grodus tries to boss the Shadow Queen around like his pet, she outright kills
                            him! Again, it's crazy (and awesome) the places
                            this Mario game goes! This boss
                            fight is intense. It is the most difficult, high-stakes boss fight of the game, and possibly
                            of the entire Paper Mario <img class="imageR boss4 png" src="Images/pmttyd/shadowqueen.png"

                            It is extremely thrilling, with Mario and the
                            Shadow Queen
                            trading blows back and forth. <img class="imageL boss3 png"
