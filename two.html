        Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door is regarded by many to be the greatest game in the series. From its
        extremely distinct personalities and locations, to its grand and investing story, to its tight and engaging
        gameplay, this game leaves very little room for improvement.

                            The game opens with Princess Peach, on a royal trip, takes a stop at the not-so-inviting
                            town of Rogueport. Rogueport is home to many criminals and lower-class individuals, which
                            becomes apparent the second you arrive there. While there,
                            Princess Peach gets given a
                            mysterious treasure, and writes a letter to Mario, inviting him to come have a look at it.
                            However, by the time Mairo arrives, the Princess is missing! It is up to Mario to slowly
                            piece together what happened, and save Princess Peach from whoever took her.

                            The battle system of this game has the same root mechanics as its predecessor, while
                            introducing many new ones as well that freshen things up. One major difference is that
                            Mario's partners have their own health, and can now also be tartgeted by enemies when they
                            attack. This adds a new layer of strategy, alowing allies to take hits that Mario would
                            otherwise have to endure, and it also gives the partners a sense of impermenance in battle.
                            Mario's partners can also use items and badges just like Mario could in the previous game,
                            making partners a lot more varsatile in what they can do. <br>Another big change is that
                            enemies can come holding items or badges, adding a new element of unpredictability that was
                            not seen in Paper Mario 64. Sometimes these items <img class="imageR jpg landscape"
                                src="Images/pmttyd/stylish.gif" alt="Stylish Move">can really give you a run for your
                            money.
                            <br>The third major addition to combat is <img class="inline"
                                src="Images/pmttyd/stylish.png" alt="Stylish"> moves. While these do nothing to deal
                            more
                            damage to the opponent, not only are they fun to pull of and discover, but they provide
                            extra star power, allowing you to execute star moves more frequently. Nearly every
                            move has<img class="imageL jpg landscape" src="Images/pmttyd/superguard.jpg"
                                alt="Mario Superguarding">
                            a stylish timing that you can discover by simply pressing <img class="inline"
                                src="Images/pmttyd/Abutton.png" alt="A"> at the right time. They are extremely
                            satisfying and fun to pull off, adding even more engagement to
                            the battle system. <br>And
                            finally, <abbr title="The Thousand Year Door">TTYD</abbr> intorduces a new defencive move
                            that you can do with really prciese timing, the superguard. This move is
                            effectively a
                            counterattack, negating all incoming damage, and in turn dealing one damage back to the
                            attacker. While this is extremely satisfying to pull of, I find that if you really get the
                            timing down, it takes away a lot of the challenge that the game would otherwise have if you
                            could only defend.

                            The overworld gameplay of Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door is also very iterative upon
                            its
                            predecessor. Because of the upgraded power from the N64 to the Gamecube, <abbr

                            gameplay
                            elements on top of Mario and his partners' overworld abilities. Throughout the game, mario
                            gets
                            <i>"cursed"</i>, providing him with <img class="imageR jpg landscape"

                            tube, as well as fold sideways to be parallel to the camera's view. These curses add a lot
                            more variety to the types of puzzles you have to solve to progress, as well as opening up
                            the design of the areas to new possibilities.

                            adds onto its predecessor is the amount of side content the player gets to do. For one, in
                            Rogueport, there's an entire quest board, called the Trouble Center, taking the player all
                            across the game for them to solve all sorts of problems and get useful rewards for doing
                            them. This adds to the game a whole lot
                            moer to do, and also really fleshes out the world in which you are exploring. You can even
                            get an entirely optional extra party member for doing a certain quest! <br>Another big
                            piece of side content is the Pit of 100 Trials, which I absolutely love. Effectively, it is
                            a gauntlet of pure battling through 100 descending floors. The enemies get more difficult as
                            you go, and it can become an extreme challenge very quickly. This is especially so because
                            you don't have any way of re-stocking on items as you go. Once you go down into the pit,
                            there's no pausing and coming back later, you either keep <img class="imageR jpg landscape"
                                src="Images/pmttyd/pitof100trials.jpg" alt="Pit Of 100 Trials">going, or exit and
                            restart from
                            floor 1 later. There's also a very tough final boss awaiting you at floor 100, amounting to
                            the ultimate test after you have already endured 99 floors of pure fighting. You also get
                            reqarded with very useful badges every 10 floors, making the trips down feel very
                            fulfilling. My favourite way to tackle the pit is going another 10 floors each chapter,
                            allowing me to reap the rewards of the badges through my playthrough as well as go to the
                            floor that I believe matches the limit of my current strength.
