        Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door is regarded by many to be the greatest game in the series. From its
        extremely distinct personalities and locations, to its grand and investing story, to its tight and engaging
        gameplay, this game leaves very little room for improvement.

                            The game opens with Princess Peach, on a royal trip, takes a stop at the not-so-inviting
                            town of Rogueport. Rogueport is home to many criminals and lower-class individuals, which
                            becomes apparent the second you arrive there. While there,
                            Princess Peach gets given a
                            mysterious treasure, and writes a letter to Mario, with a mysterious treasure map attatched.
                            Peach invited Mario to come meet her so they can have a look at what it may mean.
                            However, by the time Mairo arrives, the Princess is missing! It is up to Mario to slowly
                            piece together what happened, and save Princess Peach from whoever took her.

                            The battle system of this game has the same root mechanics as its predecessor, while
                            introducing many new ones as well that freshen things up. One major difference is that
                            Mario's partners have their own health, and can now also be tartgeted by enemies when they
                            attack. This adds a new layer of strategy, alowing allies to take hits that Mario would
                            otherwise have to endure, and it also gives the partners a sense of impermenance in battle.
                            Mario's partners can also use items and badges just like Mario could in the previous game,
                            making partners a lot more varsatile in what they can do. <br>Another big change is that
                            enemies can come holding items or badges, adding a new element of unpredictability that was
                            not seen in Paper Mario 64. Sometimes these items <img class="imageR jpg landscape"
                                src="Images/pmttyd/stylish.gif" alt="Stylish Move">can really give you a run for your
                            money.
                            <br>The third major addition to combat is <img class="inline"
                                src="Images/pmttyd/stylish.png" alt="Stylish"> moves. While these do nothing to deal
                            more
                            damage to the opponent, not only are they fun to pull of and discover, but they provide
                            extra star power, allowing you to execute star moves more frequently. Nearly every
                            move has<img class="imageL jpg landscape" src="Images/pmttyd/superguard.jpg"
                                alt="Mario Superguarding">
                            a stylish timing that you can discover by simply pressing <img class="inline"
                                src="Images/pmttyd/Abutton.png" alt="A"> at the right time. They are extremely
                            satisfying and fun to pull off, adding even more engagement to
                            the battle system. <br>And
                            finally, <abbr title="The Thousand Year Door">TTYD</abbr> intorduces a new defencive move
                            that you can do with really prciese timing, the superguard. This move is
                            effectively a
                            counterattack, negating all incoming damage, and in turn dealing one damage back to the
                            attacker. While this is extremely satisfying to pull of, I find that if you really get the
                            timing down, it takes away a lot of the challenge that the game would otherwise have if you
                            could only defend.

                            The overworld gameplay of Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door is also very iterative upon
                            its
                            predecessor. Because of the upgraded power from the N64 to the Gamecube, <abbr

                            explore, making for much more detailed, immersive, and grand areas. There's also new
                            gameplay
                            elements on top of Mario and his partners' overworld abilities. Throughout the game, mario
                            gets
                            <i>"cursed"</i>, providing him with <img class="imageR jpg landscape"

                            tube, as well as fold sideways to be parallel to the camera's view. These curses add a lot
                            more variety to the types of puzzles you have to solve to progress, as well as opening up
                            the design of the areas to new possibilities.

                            adds onto its predecessor is the amount of side content the player gets to do. For one, in
                            Rogueport, there's an entire quest board, called the Trouble Center, taking the player all
                            across the game for them to solve all sorts of problems and get useful rewards for doing
                            them. This adds to the game a whole lot
                            moer to do, and also really fleshes out the world in which you are exploring. You can even
                            get an entirely optional extra party member for doing a certain quest! <br>Another big
                            piece of side content is the Pit of 100 Trials, which I absolutely love. Effectively, it is
                            a gauntlet of pure battling through 100 descending floors. The enemies get more difficult as
                            you go, and it can become an extreme challenge very quickly. This is especially so because
                            you don't have any way of re-stocking on items as you go. Once you go down into the pit,
                            there's no pausing and coming back later, you either keep <img class="imageR jpg landscape"
                                src="Images/pmttyd/pitof100trials.jpg" alt="Pit Of 100 Trials">going, or exit and
                            restart from
                            floor 1 later. There's also a very tough final boss awaiting you at floor 100, amounting to
                            the ultimate test after you have already endured 99 floors of pure fighting. You also get
                            reqarded with very useful badges every 10 floors, making the trips down feel very
                            fulfilling. My favourite way to tackle the pit is going another 10 floors each chapter,
                            allowing me to reap the rewards of the badges through my playthrough as well as go to the
                            floor that I believe matches the limit of my current strength.

                            The game begins with Mario arriving at Rogueport, and not one minute later seeing a fight
                            break out between Goombella and Lord Crump. Lord Crump's is one of the higher-ups of the
                            group called the X-Nauts, who are a group of high-tech, mysterious, and kinda wierd folks.
                            Regardless, it will later be revealed that they are the big bads of the game, and are
                            responsible for taking Princess Peach! After this run-in with the X-Nauts, Goombella takes
                            Mario to visit Professor Frankly, who's an old goomba who it well versed in history. Mario
                            consults him about his treasure map that Peach sent him, and Frankly tells him that it is a
                            legendary treasure map that guides him to the Crystal Stars, which are very magical and
                            powerful objects sealed away long ago. It is said that these crystal stars can be
                            used to
                            open the 1000 year door and find the fabled legendary treasure within. With that in mind,
                            Mario embarks on his newest advanture to <img class="boss1 png imageR"

                            sewers to have
                            a look at The Thousand Year Door and hold his map aloft at it to get the location of the

                            Being the first chapter of the game, it does an incredibly good job of setting the tone of
                            advanture and excitement. From the music to the visuals, you can tell right away that this
                            journey will be a special one. The first area, Petal Meadows, is similar in nature to
                            Pleasant Path of Paper Mario 64, very introductory and grassy, but that's not a bad thing.
                            This chapter serves as a great introduction into overworld and battle mechanics. Once Mario
                            arrives at the local town, PetalBurg, it's there he discovers that it's being terrorized by
                            a dragon that lives nearby. Mario takes it upon himself to help the village and defeat the
                            dragon. But before he does, Koops stops him and begs Mario to let him join. Mario of course
                            agrees, and tehy set of to the dragon, Hooktail's, Castle. Inside, numerous dry bones roam,
                            showing all the koopas <img class="boss3 png imageR" src="Images/pmttyd/hooktail.png"
                                alt="Hooktail">who had fallen before. This castle consists of a lot of puzzles to do
                            with Koops' abilities, and it's a very fun one to make your way through, with many secrets
                            dotted about as well. Halfway through the castle, Mario received his second "curse" from the
                            black chest ghost, allowing him to flip sideways. At the top, Mario faces Hooktail the
                            dragon in a very dynamic and grand-scoped boss fight. It really signifies the step-up in
                            ambition and power that this game has over its predecessor. After defeating Hooktail, Mario
                            obtains his first crystal star.
