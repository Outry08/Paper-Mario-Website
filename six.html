        Paper Mario 64 was the one that started it all. Its gameplay, world, and story are all very well put
        together, but still leave room for improvement, making this game the perfect series starter.

                            The story begins with Mario being invited to Princess Peach's castle for a celebration of
                            the
                            Mushroom Kingdom. But then, not long after he arrives, so too does Bowser. This time, Bowser
                            brought with him a new toy; the Star Rod <img height="25px" src="Images/starrod.png"
                                alt="Star Rod">which he stole from Star Haven. It has the power
                            to grant any wish, which is
                            dangerous in the hands of Bowser. After losing to the sheer bowser of the Star Rod, Mario
                            has to
                            embark on a quest to save the Star Spirits that bowser imprisoned, in hopes that their power
                            can
                            be enough to overthrow Bowser and his Star Rod.

                            The battle system in this game is very simplistic, yet incredibly effective. While many
                            RPGs love to inflate the numbers to extremely high amounts (Eg. "YOU DID 13356 DMG!"), this
                            game keeps the numbers low, which I really like. It adds to the strategy of things
                            because it makes the damage and HP numbers countable, so every turn can be completely
                            calculated to your desires. <br>During your turn, you can do one of five things: Jump
                            attack, <img class="landscape jpg imageR" src="Images/pm64/pm64battle.jpg">Hammer attack,
                            Use an
                            item,
                            Use a star
                            power, or Swap your partner. Choosing between jumping and hammering is very engaging,
                            because certain enemies are too high up to be hammered, while others can be spiky, making
                            them unable to be jumped on (without getting hurt). <br>In addition to Mario's turn, one of
                            your partner characters also get to attack. They have many unique abilities, and choosing
                            between them all and integrating them into your strategy feels very satifying.<br>This game
                            also uses action commands,
                            allowing the player to time their button presses to maximize damage, and defend against
                            enemy attacks. The implemntation of action commands in this game is flawless, they feel so
                            good to do!

                            other
                            main part of the gameplay is the overworld gameplay. This is where the game's
                            world comes to life. This game's overworld gample has multiple types of gameplay elements,
                            being
                            puzzles,
                            platforming, and exploration. The combination of all of these elements is
                            seamless, making it a joy to explore the world. <br>The puzzles are all very unique, and
                            constantly use new elements and partner abilities throughout the game. It's also very cool
                            when you unlock a new ability, and find ways to use it in areas that you've already
                            explored, making the exploration very engaging. <br>The platforming is
                            very simplistic, but I think that's what adds to the seamless nature of the overworld
                            gameplay.

                            mentioned
                            before, the badge system is what really makes this game shine in my opinion.
                            The amount to which you can tailor your gameplay style with the badges you pick is awesome!
                            Basically how it works is you have a certain number of badge points, which you
                            can allot to
                            different badges that you acquire throughout your journey. You can mix and match, swap out,
                            and add new badges to your loadout whenever you want, making it extremely flexible.
                            <br>There's three main types of badges: Move badges, Stat badges, and Helper badges.
                            <br>Move badges <img height="15px" src="Images/pm64/quakehammer.png"

                            easier action command timing, or alerts for nearby collectibles.
                            <br>With so many diverse
                            choices, and more as you go thoughout the game, this game is incredibly replayable. Each
                            badge loadout completely changes your style of play, and it is incredibly fun to experiment
                            with!
