        Paper Mario: The Origami King was released amid the global pandemic to much anticipation. The game
        takes
        another couple of big leaps forward to reach the spectacle that was the first three games. With a much more
        compelling story and beautiful visuals and music, this game is a work of art that I personally hold up there
        with the first three titles.

                            completely empty. Confused, the brothers head into Peach's Castle. Once they get into the
                            pain lobby, Luigi falls down a pitfall, and Princess Peach emerges from the shadows,
                            although she's now folded into Origami Peach! Mario then falls down the same pitfall as
                            Luigi, ending up in a dungeon, wondering what happened to Princess Peach.

                            Mario's job to rotate and slide the rings around him to line enemies up in an orderly line
                            or 2x2 square. Once he does this or runs out of time, Mario begins

                            one action per group of enemies, typically you choose jumping for a line of enemies and

                            Color
                            Splash, but there are <img class="imageR landscape jpg" src="Images/pmok/battleattack.jpg"

                            This battle system is certainly unique, leaving some fans really liking it, while other
                            fans not really liking it as much. I really enjoy the battles for what they are. Solving the
                            puzzles can sometimes be very tricky but satisfying when you figure them out. One thing I
                            don't like as much is that the battles <topic>don't really feel like battles</topic> at all.
                            It really is
                            just the puzzle. If you solve the puzzle, you can win the battle without a scratch, but if
                            you don't solve the puzzle, only then will the enemies be able to
                            attack. This means that if
                            you're very good at the puzzles, the enemies are never more than pieces on a puzzle board.
                            Additionally, to many fans' dismay, <topic>experience points</topic> for battling have still
                            yet to return.
                            Although you do get a boatload of coins for battling, which can be used to purchase
                            accessories that boost your stats, so honestly, the lack of experience points isn't too bad
                            in this game in my opinion. The <img class="imageL landscape jpg"
                                src="Images/pmok/bossbattlepath.jpg" alt="Boss Battle">
                            <topic>boss fights</topic> of the game take the ring-puzzle
                            mechanic in a
                            different direction and place the boss in the middle of the ring and Mario on the outside.
                            It is Mario's job to rotate the rings to make a path from where he is to the boss in order
                            to attack it. These boss fights are actually pretty cool and a very unique concept. They
                            don't suffer the same fate as the regular battles not feeling like battles, as you can never
                            beat a boss in one turn, so it feels like a true back-and-forth battle.

                            The overworld gameplay of The Origami King might be my favourite of the bunch. This game
                            pushed the <topic>visual power</topic> of the switch to its absolute limit, making the
                            locations you visit
                            nothing
                            short of stunning. They are also incredibly dynamic and much larger than the
                            <img class="imageL landscape jpg" src="Images/pmok/overworld.jpg" alt="Overworld">previous
                            games. Apart from just the visuals, because the areas are so expansive,
                            there's a lot
                            more to them and a lot more to do. This game also moved away from the world map and
                            level structure of the previous two games, opting for an <topic>interconnected world</topic>
                            once again
                            just
                            like Paper Mario 64 and <abbr title="The Thousand-Year Door">TTYD</abbr>. This is much
                            better in my opinion and adds a sense of immersion into the world that the <img

                            simply can't emulate. This game also takes a bit of inspiration from Super Paper Mario and
                            incorporates some overworld battles in the form of <topic>Paper Macho enemies</topic>. These
                            battles are
                            fun but not super deep. It essentially just consists of hitting them with your hammer a
                            couple of times and avoiding their attacks, but they are a fun and welcome addition. There's
                            <img class="landscape2 imageL jpg" src="Images/pmok/1000foldarms.jpg"
                                alt="1000-Fold Arms">also a new ability that Mario gets granted, called the
                            <topic>1000-fold arms</topic>. Mario can use them to
                            extend his arms very far to grab, pull, and tear objects in the
                            environment to solve puzzles
                            and access new places. It's not a game-changing new ability, but it is a fun addition to
                            puzzles and environmental interactivity.

                            The major addition to the gameplay in this game is its plethora of collectibles. This game
                            leans into the collect-a-thon style more than any other game in the series, and I am here
                            for it. It adds so much enjoyment and interactivity to<img class="imageR landscape jpg"
                                src="Images/pmok/nonbottomlesspit.jpg" alt="Non-Bottomless Pit"> the overworld that the
                            previous games
                            just don't have as much of. Firstly, there are <topic>non-bottomless pits</topic> that Mario
                            can fill up
                            using confetti. This is very similar to the painting mechanic of Color Splash, where Mario
                            can get confetti from the overworld as well as battling. These
                            non-bottomless pits are scattered all over the place and are sometimes necessary to fill in
                            to progress. I always get excited to fill one in whenever I see one. Another major
                            collectible are <topic>toads</topic>. Hundreds of toads have been folded up into various
                            types of origami, such as a
                            flower, butterfly, or dog. All Mario has to do is hit them with his hammer
                            to unfold them.
                            It's incredibly fun to scour new areas to <img class="imageR landscape2 jpg"
                                src="Images/pmok/toaddog.jpg" alt="Toad folded into a dog">try and find them all. Some
                            of them are pretty
                            well hidden! <img class="landscape2 imageL jpg" src="Images/pmok/questionblock.jpg"
                                alt="Question Block">This game also has <topic>collectible figurines</topic> that you
                            find in treasure
                            chests,
                            receive from other characters
                            for helping them, or purchase in shops.
                            These trophies are
                            just as fun to collect and find as the other collectibles I have mentioned so far and
                            pertain to the events of your adventure as they are happening. The fourth
                            major collectible
                            is none other than hitting <topic>question blocks</topic>. I never would have
                            expected them to work as a
                            tracked statistic in your playthrough, but they work
                            incredibly well. Every time I see a
                            question block I <img class="imageL landscape jpg" src="Images/pmok/collectibletreasure.jpg"
                                alt="Collectible Treasure">haven't hit yet, I immediately start heading in
                            that direction. They are so
                            much fun to find, and especially so if they are invisible. There are so many times
                            throughout
                            the game where you think to yourself <i>"I wonder, is there an
                                invisible block there?"</i>
                            and then you swing your hammer and uncover the block! It's super fun. These four
                            collectibles dotted about your adventure add more than you would think to the joy of
                            exploring the worlds that this game offers.

                            Bobby the Bob-omb is the first partner you meet after Olivia. He may not look it, but he is
                            one of the <topic>most memorable characters</topic> of the game. When you first meet him,
                            you discover that he has
                            <topic>dementia</topic>, and doesn't really remember much about himself or anything for that
                            matter. He's
                            just been going through life seeing where the world takes him. He has no overworld ability,
                            and in battle, he doesn't do much beyond just bumping a single enemy on occasion.

                            ancient ruins. He's a much more one-dimensional character than Bobby is. His overworld

                            After Mario gets sent to the <topic>dungeon underneath Peach's Castle</topic>, he soon finds
                            Olivia trapped
                            within the wall. He breaks Olivia free using the 1000-fold arms and then breaks his way out
                            of his cell. There, he finds the place crawling with origami Shy Guys, so he stealthily
                            avoids them. Mario then witnesses the rather gruesome-looking transformation of a paper
                            enemy
                            into an origami soldier. A little ways further, Mario finds and saves wet floor sign Bowser,
                            and then together they make their way out of the dungeon. Now on the roof of Peach's Castle,
                            they get ambushed by more folded shy guy soldiers, and we get our first look at the main
                            villain, The Origami King, <topic>King Olly</topic>. King Olly happens to be Olivia's
                            brother, who seems to
                            have become twisted into wanting the whole world to become Origami. Olly then begins
                            wrapping Peach's castle up in streamers, with Mario, Bowser, and Olivia just narrowly
                            escaping in a cool action sequence. The streamers then literally uproot Peach's Castle and
                            place it atop a faraway mountain. While escaping, Mario and Olivia get hurdled out of
                            Bowser's clown car by some debris and get sent flying into the
                            <topic>Whispering Woods</topic>. There
                            Mario gets access to confetti and learns the mechanic of filling in non-bottomless pits, as
                            well as getting used to the battle mechanics. After making their way through the woods, they
                            arrive in <topic>Toad Town</topic>, which is now overrun with Paper Macho soldiers. This is
                            where Mario is
                            introduced to the real-time battles with them. After clearing them all out, Mario and Olivia
                            decide that they need to follow each of the coloured streamers to cut them off at the
                            source. The bridge forward is broken though, <img class="boss1 imageR png"

                            his go-kart to find the key to Princess Peach's Castle. After this, Mario and Olivia set off
                            to cut the Red Streamer loose at its source.

                            The path to the Red Streamer takes Mario to <topic>Picnic Road</topic>, which is the first
                            real showcase of
                            how beautiful and expansive the areas in this game are. The colourful flowers make the place
                            extremely pretty. This is also the first place riddled with folded-up toads at every turn,
                            making it a joy to explore. Soon, Mario finds the <topic>Earth Vellumental Temple</topic>.
                            After finding
                            the 5 stones needed to open it up, Mario makes his way through the temple and finds the
                            legendary Earth Vellumental itself, which is a massive origami turtle. This is where Mario
                            gets introduced to the boss fight mechanics of the game, and then defeats the Earth
                            Vellumental. Upon defeating it, Olivia gains the power of transforming into the Earth
                            Vellumental, along with gaining its Earth powers. They then press forward through Picnic
                            Road and toward the Overlook Tower, where the Red Streamer is coming from. The climb up
                            <topic>Overlook Mountain</topic> is very enjoyable, filled with many more collectibles and
                            battles. Once
                            they arrive
                            at the <topic>Overlook Tower</topic>, Mario has to spend all the confetti he has patching up
                            the entire first floor.
                            This makes for a very cool way of restricting the
                            player's progress to one floor at a
                            time,
                            with Mario gaining just enough confetti on the current floor to reach the next floor
                            up.
                            Once he makes it to the top, he gets <img class="imageR boss3 png"
                                src="Images/pmok/coloredpencils.png" alt="Colored Pencils">ambushed by a bunch of
                            coloured pencil missiles. After
                            dodging them for a bit, Mario reaches the very top of the tower and faces off with the boss
                            guarding the red streamer, the <img class="boss1 imageL png"

                            defeating them, Mario uses his 1000-fold arms to bash down the source of the red streamer,
                            ending the first chapter.

                            Mario and Olivia decide to go after the Blue Streamer next, which appears to be in the
                            direction of <topic>Autumn Mountain</topic>, which Mario takes a gondola to get to. It is on
                            the gondola
                            that he meets Bobby, who decides to join Mario so that he has some friends. Together, the
                            three of them explore the beautiful Autumn Mountain, with Bobby getting himself into trouble
                            more than once. Eventually, they find the <topic>Water Vellumental Shrine</topic>. Inside
                            consists mainly
                            of water-based puzzles including slide puzzles. At the end of the temple, Mario battles the
                            Water Vellumental, which is a water dragon. It has the ability to wash away tiles on the
                            battle ring, making this
                            a tricky fight. Once defeated, Olivia gets the power of the Water Vellumental, which she
                            uses to fill up a dried-out river on the mountain. They then hop on a white-water gondola
                            ride, complete with whirlpools and debris blocking their way. At the bottom of the river,
                            Mario, Olivia, and Bobby find themselves at a theme park, <topic>Shogun Studios</topic>,
                            which is themed all
                            around ninjas. This theme park is a large area with numerous little buildings and
                            attractions to see and do, and it is a lot of fun to explore. Mario finds Luigi in the theme
                            park, who had found what he thought was the Key to Princess Peach's Castle, but was actually
                            for the Big Sho' Theatre. Upon noticing this, Luigi sets off once again in search of the key
                            to Peach's Castle. After completing multiple
                            different attractions, such as ninja star throwing and a ninja stealth house, the group
                            makes
                            their way into the main attraction, the <topic>Big Sho' Theatre</topic>. Using Luigi's key,
                            once inside, Mario
                            finds that the
                            entire audience is strapped to their seats
                            with rubber
                            bands! Mario is also forced onto the
                            stage to be part of the show, which consists of three very funny and unique shows involving
                            Paper Macho enemies, with one of them being <img class="boss3 imageL png"

                            Mario had to knock off all the rubber bands off of him to claim victory. Once he does, he
                            breaks down the next streamer spool and frees the toads, ending the chapter.

                            The beginning of this chapter is nothing short of a masterpiece in story. Firstly, the
                            celebration at Shogun Studios has a fireworks show, which triggers
                            <topic>Bobby's memory</topic> to come
                            back! Although he chooses not to elaborate further just yet. Then, Mario, Olivia, and Bobby
                            head further down the river, arriving at <topic>Sweetpaper Valley</topic>. Shortly after
                            arriving, they get
                            ambushed by King Olly, who drops a massive boulder in from of the way forward, stopping
                            Mario and Co. dead in their tracks and crushing Olivia underneath it! After thinking about
                            what
                            to do, Bobby tells Mario he has an idea, and to follow him, again, without explaining
                            further. Bobby tells Mario that they need to find the cruise ship, called
                            <topic>The Princess Peach</topic>. Mario finds the boat captain in Toad Town and asks him to
                            take them there. Once they
                            arrive, The Princess Peach is in shambles, and completely abandoned. Going through the dead
                            ship is extremely suspenseful, and you are filled with confusion, about what Bobby has
                            planned and what happened to this poor ship. After exploring the baron ship, Mario and Bobby
                            arrive in the VIP room, where Bobby picks up a box, telling Mario that it's what he came
                            for.
                            On their way out, however, they get attacked by the <topic>Paper Macho Gooper Blooper
                            </topic>
                            out of
                            nowhere. This is the first Paper Macho boss fight that Mario does, and it's quite a fun
                            one! After defeating the Gooper Blooper, Mario and Bobby head on back to Sweetpaper Valley
                            where the boulder is. This is where <topic>Bobby reveals all</topic> about his memories and
                            what was in the
                            box. He tells Mario that he and his friends saved up enough money to get into the VIP room
                            on the Princess Peach. But after a little while, it got attacked by the Gooper Blooper which
                            knocked off Bobby's fuse. Bobby <img class="boss3 imageR png"
                                src="Images/pmok/papermachogooperblooper.png" alt="Paper Macho Gooper Blooper">was the
                            only one of his friends to survive, but with no
                            memory of the event. What was in the box was none other than an extra fuse he and his
                            friends had kept in their room, and he was going to use it to explode the boulder away and
                            free Olivia. After thanking Mario for taking him with him and providing him closure, Bobby
                            lights the fuse before Mario gets the chance to change his mind. And then Bobby was gone,
                            along with the boulder. This whole sequence is incredibly emotional, and I feel the weight
                            of the loss of Bobby every time I play through it. And I don't get emotional often either!

                            Once Olivia wakes up from where the boulder once was, she immediately asks where Bobby is.
                            Mario then tells her with a heavy heart what had happened, and she immediately bursts into
                            tears and runs off into the cave ahead. Mario follows her into the
                            <topic>Breezy Tunnel</topic>, trying to
                            catch up with her. After navigating through a Monty Mole mining operation, Mario funds
                            Olivia in a dark corner, crying. Mario mourns with her and tries to cheer her up, but
                            nothing works. With nothing else to do, Mario scouts out the area ahead and leaves Olivia to
                            be alone for a bit. No sooner does Mario see <topic>Bobby's ghost</topic> within a nearby
                            rock pile. Bobby
                            tells him that he shouldn't worry about him, <img class="boss1 imageR png"
                                src="Images/pmok/ghostbobby.png" alt="Ghost Bobby">and to tell Olivia the same thing.
                            With Bobby's
                            words of encouragement, Mario heads back to Olivia and is able to cheer her up
                            using a
                            goofy Paper Macho Gooma mask that had made Olivia laugh previously. Without being able to
                            resist, Olivia is cheered up by this act, and Mario and Olivia press onward through the
                            Breezy Tunnel stronger than ever.

                            Within the Breezy Tunnel, Mario picks up a boot car, which is very useful in traversing the
                            <topic>Scorching Sandpaper Desert</topic>, where they arrive next. The Scorching Sandpaper
                            Desert is
                            another immaculate showcase of how big and ambitious the areas in this game are, practically
                            necessitating the use of the boot car <img class="boss4 imageR png"
                                src="Images/pmok/papermachopokey.png" alt="Paper Macho Pokey">to get around. It appears
                            that in the desert, the sun
                            is missing, causing the environment to be locked in a gloomy, yet pretty night. After riding
                            around the desert, Mario finds the local town, <topic>Snif City</topic>, which is home to a
                            bunch of
                            party-centric Snifits. After exploring the town, Mario heads back out into the desert and
                            encounters the giant Paper Macho Pokey, a second Paper Macho boss. After defeating it, Mario
                            rescues Professor Toad, from whom Mario enlists his help to find the yellow streamer.
                            Professor Toad helps them to uncover the secret <topic>Fire Vellumental Cave</topic>, which
                            Mario then
                            goes in to explore. After some platforming through a lot of fire and lava, Mario battles the

                            flames is crucial to
                            this fight. Once defeated, Olivia gains the power of the Fire Vellumental, which she then

                            Upon rescuing a legendary sea-farer, Captain T. Ode, Mario and Olivia next travel to
                            <topic>The Great Sea</topic>. This is a super fun, fully open ocean for you to explore, with
                            11 islands and
                            numerous sunken treasures to find. I always take my time and explore every inch of it! One
                            of the islands, Bonehead Island, is a neat reference to Paper Mario: Color Splash's Fortune
                            Island. A very important island is the <topic>Mushroom Island</topic>, in which some lore is
                            given. Mario
                            encounters Luigi on the island as well, who believes yet again that he found the Key to
                            Princess Peach's Castle. Instead, it was the key to Diamond Island, which meant that
                            Luigi had to set off yet again to try and find the key to Peach's Castle. Inside
                            the
                            mushroom house, Mario saves a special toad, called the Origami Craftsman.<img
                                class="inline boss2" src="Images/pmok/origamicraftsman.png" alt="Origami Craftsman"> He
                            then explains
                            that he was the one who created Olly using the special and forbidden
                            life-giving fold technique for the Origami Festival. It turns out that King Olly had since
                            used that same technique to fold together Olivia! After this, Mario travels to the three
                            card-face islands, Club, Spade, and Heart Island, to then unlock
                            <topic>Diamond Island</topic>. Inside the
                            Diamond Island are three trials, Power, Wisdom, and Courage. Before completing the trials,
                            Mario heads into the <topic>Ice Vellumental Mountain</topic>. This mountain consists of
                            puzzles to do with
                            sliding around on ice platforms. At the end, Mario finds the Ice Vellumental, which is a
                            giant polar bear. After defeating it, Olivia gains its power, which she then uses to freeze
                            the moats around the trials, enabling Mario to enter them. Mario and Olivia then travel
                            to the source of the purple streamer, the Sea Tower. <topic>The Sea Tower</topic>
                            is a combination shrine of
                            all four Vellumentals, taking an aspect from <img class="imageL boss4 png"

                            requiring Olivia
                            to make use of all four of their powers. At the top, Mario finds the next big boss,
                            <topic>Tape</topic>. Mario first destroys his case, which unleashes the tape's inner
                            speed demon. He is
                            able to tape pieces of the battle ring together, <img class="imageR boss1 png"

                            chapter.

                            Atop the Sea Tower, Olivia uses her four Vellumental abilities once again to activate a
                            magical tractor beam, which Mario then uses to ascend high up into the sky. It is here that
                            Mario arrives at the <topic>Shangri-Spa</topic>, which is a spa up in the clouds. Outside of
                            the lobby,
                            Mario runs into Kamek, whom Olivia funnily believes is the caretaker of the spa. Mario then
                            makes his way to the central area, where he sees none other than Bowsers Castle,
                            crash-landed
                            on top of the main building of the spa. That explains why Bowser's minions are all over the
                            place cleaning up after the crash landing. The castle is being guarded by an origami Boss
                            Sumo Bro, blocking access to it entirely. Just then, Bowser Jr. comes flying by, attempting
                            to regain access to the castle but is no sooner cut up into pieces by a pair of scissors
                            that emerged from the castle. This is a cool nod to how we first beat Bowser Jr. back at the
                            start of Paper Mario: Sticker Star. Kamek quickly runs to Bowser Jr's aid and seeks Mario's
                            help to go with
                            him to the four rejuvenating hot springs of the spa to put Bowser Jr. back to his old self
                            again.
                            Three of the spas are simple enough to get to, with the fourth taking the group on a journey
                            through a maze-like jungle that is part of the <topic>Spring of the Jungle Mist</topic>. In

                            nearly getting lost, Mario, Kamek, and Olivia nearly get eaten alive by a relentless Paper
                            Macho Chain Chomp. It's literally an instant game over if it catches you! After this, Bowser
                            Jr. is fully rejuvenated, but then spends too much time in one of the springs, and loses all
                            of his color, requiring him to go to the secret fifth hot spring, the rainbow hot spring. In
                            order to get there, Mario must win the game show, <topic>Shy Guys Finish Last</topic>! This
                            game show is
                            heavily inspired by Snifit or Whiffit, and is a fun <img class="boss1 imageR png"

                            complete. I couldn't even do it until my second playthrough! Once Mario wins Shy Guys Finish

                            Next, inside <topic>Bowser's Castle</topic>, there's an absolute mess, with countless
                            origami
                            soldiers
                            making a mess of the place.
                            Just as they begin to unleash an assault on Mario, all of Bowser's regular paper minions
                            come and commence an all-out brawl with the folded soldiers, allowing Mario to pass. When
                            making
                            his way through a somewhat creepy and empty hallway, Kamek suddenly vanishes after going on
                            ahead, sending a chill down Mario and Olivia's spines. A little further in, and the two
                            encounter none other than Luigi again! This time he has the key to the inner room of
                            Bowser's Castle instead of Peach's Castle. Determined to find the right key, Luigi sets off
                            again. After this, on their way back to the main room. Olivia
                            herself vanishes! Now really creeped out, Mario makes his way back to the entrance of the
                            castle and finds that all the minions, both paper and folded, are also eerily absent.
                            Mario then begins encountering these very creepy, all-black, cutout soldiers. This whole
                            part of the game is done incredibly well and really gets you on edge. After defeating them,
                            Mario finds who had been taking everyone, which is the snake-like <topic>Handaconda</topic>.
                            The battle
                            with the Handaconda is effectively rock-paper-scissors, which is pretty fun and doesn't take
                            too long, so it doesn't get tedious. After triumphing over the Handaconda, Olivia is saved,
                            but Kamek and the rest of the minions <img class="boss3 imageR png"
                                src="Images/pmok/handaconda.png" alt="Handaconda">are still nowhere to be seen. In the
                            following hallway
                            is something extremely unsettling. Mario walks over the shredded remains of all of Bowser's
                            minions including Kamek and Bowser Jr. Even though everybody in this world is paper, it's
                            just the thought of it that leaves me aghast <img class="imageL boss1 png"

                            risks just like the older games in the series. After this room, Mario comes face to face
                            with a <topic>Paper Macho Buzzy Beetle</topic> that is completely covered in the shredded
                            remains of the
                            minions. Upon defeating it, Mario then has to fight the true culprit behind all this, the
                            Scissors.

                            The <topic>Scissors</topic> might just be my favourite boss in the game. The fight starts
                            with
                            him "showing mercy" by equipping his scissor cover and shielding his sharp blades. He then
                            warns
                            Mario by saying "If you destroy this cover, all bets are off!" which adds an incredible
                            amount of intimidation to this fight. To get the full experience of the battle against the
                            Scissors, I of
                            course destroy the cover right away. Doing
                            so unleashes the full fury of the scissors, and when he said all bets are off, he
                            <i>MEANT</i> it. Every single time he attacks, it is either you dodge it, or it's an instant
                            game over,
                            with no in-between. The stakes in this fight give such a rush of intensity and adrenaline
                            that I love this fight for. Every dodge you can <i>feel</i> the sharp blades just barely
                            grazing Mario. The music of this fight also <img class="imageR boss3 png"
                                src="Images/pmok/scissors.png" alt="Scissors">perfectly adds to that "all bets are off"
                            feeling, and completely elevates this whole boss experience! If you are good with your
                            dodges, or of course never break the case, Mario
                            emerges victorious, reversing all of the doings of the scissors, thus putting all of
                            Bowser's minions back together. Mario then destroys the final streamer spool, ending his and
                            Olivia's quest to destroy them all!

                            After defeating the Scissors, Mario frees Bowser, who was imprisoned in his own castle.
                            After this, Bowser offers to take Mario and Olivia in his <topic>airship</topic> up to
                            Princess Peach's
                            castle now that all the streamers have been destroyed. Once on board, the airship almost
                            immediately begins being targeted by King Olly's Paper airplane armada. Mario takes control
                            of the gunner position on the airship in a shooter section of the game. Eventually, after
                            fending off numerous small paper airplanes, a massive one comes flying in and collides
                            straight into the ship. The airship then crash-lands in the <topic>Hotfoot Crater</topic>.
                            Mario, Olivia,
                            Bowser, Kamek, and Bowser Jr. then have to outrun a huge horde of Paper Macho Microgoombas.
                            Both Kamek and Bowser Jr. end up staying behind to hold off the Microgoombas while Mario,
                            Olivia, and Bowser head straight for <topic>Peach's Castle</topic>. Once there, they find
                            that the door is
                            locked. But just at that moment, Luigi arrives <img class="boss3 imageR png"
                                src="Images/pmok/paperairplane.png" alt="Paper Airplane">in the nick of time. At first,
                            he thinks he
                            has failed to get the key to Peach's Castle, but it turns out, comically, it
                            was clogged in

                            can head inside.
                            But pretty
                            much as soon as they do, the castle begins a massive transformation, becoming the
                            unrecognizable and very intimidating Origami Castle.

                            Now heading inside the <topic>Origami Castle</topic>,
                            might I just say that the music of this castle as you make your way through it is nothing
                            short of magical. The composition, with the use of violins and opera, mixed with the
                            electric
                            guitar, all blend so well to make an incredibly emotional, intimidating, and beautiful track
                            that expertly sets the tone for this final infiltration. The castle itself is an incredible
                            gauntlet of difficult battles and puzzles, with the music continuing even through the
                            battles as well! I don't have enough good things to say about the Origami Castle. It is
                            simply the perfect finale for an already incredible game. Once Mario has made his way
                            through the gauntlet, King Olly has one more surprise for him. His final general of the
                            Legion of Stationery, the <topic>Stapler</topic>. Coming off of the peak boss fight that was
                            the Scissors,
                            the Stapler isn't quite as good, but is still enjoyable and challenging. After defeating the
                            stapler, Bowser gets freed from being a wet floor sign! It turns out it was a staple that
                            was holding him like that the whole time. After this, Mario, Olivia, and Bowser make their
                            way up the <topic>final staircase</topic>, with <img class="boss3 imageR png"
                                src="Images/pmok/stapler.png" alt="Stapler">their nerves rising with every step they
                            take, until
                            finally, they reach the top. Inside the door, they first see a terrifying image of Princess
                            Peach unconscious and practically fused with the Origami Castle itself. They then see King
                            Olly along with an absolutely insane amount of Origami Cranes all over the place. It turns
                            out

                            Once Mario engages <topic>King Olly</topic>, there are three main phases of the battle.
                            First,
                            King Olly begins assuming the forms of the Vellumentals that Mario had fought before. This
                            phase is cool because Mario has full access to all four Vellumental powers himself, and has
                            to pick and choose based on the strengths and weaknesses of the Vellumental that King Olly
                            is currently using. After this, King Olly refolds himself into a sort of giga-soldier. In
                            retaliation, Olivia has the idea to do the same to Bowser and have them go head-to-head.
                            This phase involves Mario having to run around the arena and pound the ground behind Bowser
                            to give him the edge in the brawl between him and Olly. After Bowser succeeds in pushing
                            King Olly off the edge, he comes back as a giant, with nothing but rage and fury in his
                            eyes. This part is awesome. King Olly <img class="imageR boss3 png"
                                src="Images/pmok/kingolly1.png" alt="King Olly">begins by scrambling up a giant Magic
                            Circle that
                            Olivia could use to unleash a powerful attack. Mario then has to race the clock and
                            unscramble the Magic Circle, while also having to dodge King Olly's attacks.
                            After fully
                            unscrambling the Magic Circle, Olivia uses it to transform into a massive hammer that Mario
                            wields with his 1000-fold arms. After some super cinematic dodges, Mario hits Olly with the
                            massive force of the Hammer, and he finally goes down.

                            After this climactic battle, King
                            Olly begins to realize the error of his ways and says that Olivia can fold the last of the
                            <topic>Origami Cranes</topic> and use his body as the last one. Olivia then makes the wish
                            "I wish to
                            reverse everything that my brother has created". And with that, the 1000 cranes fly off and
                            magically reverse everything, putting Peach's Castle back where it belongs and unfolding all
                            the enemies. However, once the <img class="imageR landscape jpg"
                                src="Images/pmok/lanterns.jpg" alt="Floating Lanters">cranes were done, Olivia was
                            nowhere to be found. This is
                            because it was Olly himself who had folded her together, meaning
                            that she undid herself!
                            This is also an incredibly sad moment because she was such a pure soul and companion
                            throughout your whole adventure. That night, Mario, Bowser, Luigi, Princess Peach, and all
                            the citizens of Toad Town gathered together to release <topic>floating lanterns</topic> in
                            honour of the
                            Origami and Olivia.
