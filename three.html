        If I told you about a game about prophecies, interdimensional travel, and universe-ending dark magic, you
        probably
        wouldn't think of a Mario game first. Despite this, Super Paper Mario has all those story elements and more in
        the single greatest Mario storyline of the entire franchise.

                            The story begins with Mario being told Princess Peach was kidnapped, but when he and Luigi
                            arrive at Bowser's castle, Bowser hasn't done anything. At that moment, the villainous Count
                            Bleck appears. After his introduction, and attacking Mario, he vacuums everybody else up
                            into a type of black hole, everyone except Mario. This includes Bowser, his minions, and
                            Luigi. Where they get taken is a <topic>wedding between Bowser and Peach</topic>, organized
                            by Count
                            Bleck. Once he forces them to say "I do", the Chaos Heart is unleashed, and with it Count
                            Bleck gets its dark powers, making him nearly unstoppable in his quest to destroy the
                            universe.

                                alt="Mario throwing enemy">This game is the first in the series to break conventions and
                            completely change genre, from
                            turn-based RPG to a 2D platformer with RPG elements. Thus, the overworld gameplay and combat
                            both share the same gameplay. Specifically with <topic>combat</topic>, Mario's primary
                            attack is jumping on
                            enemies, just like the Mario Bros. games. However, the more partners, called Pixls, you get,
                            the
                            deeper and more interesting the combat gets. Using the abilities of the Pixls, you can
                            actually come up with some pretty cool attacks. For example, picking up an enemy and
                            throwing them at other enemies, or even planting a bomb and then throwing <i>that</i> at
                            enemies. Even though the game is a <img class="imageR landscape jpg"
                                src="Images/spm/stylish.jpg" alt="Stylish Move">2D platformer, there are still
                            experience
                            points that you
                            get for defeating enemies, making the combat feel worth it to do. The
                            <topic>stylish moves</topic> from
                            Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door also make a return. You
                            perform them by shaking the Wii remote at the right time while in midair. The more stylish
                            moves you chain together before landing, the more experience points you get. It can be
                            extremely satisfying to chain a bunch of stylish moves together and see the experience
                            points go up like crazy.

                            <topic>Platforming</topic> is the core focus of the gameplay this time around. With very
                            fluid and snappy
                            controls, it is very fun to play through the stages of the game. There are also even more

                            to solve than the last two games. Because of the sheer amount of

                            increased a
                            lot. Not only does Mario get more partners in this game than the previous games, but there
                            are
                            also multiple playable characters, who also have their
                            own abilities. Because of this great
                            amount of ability variety, it also makes it super fun to go back to previous areas to use
                            abilities you previously did not have access to, opening up new possibilities all throughout
                            the game and making it extremely explorable and replayable. I always get excited when I
                            unlock
                            a new ability because then I get to test it in a whole bunch of places.

                            between dimensions very early on in the game. This lets you flip the camera perspective 90
                            degrees, changing the gameplay from 2D to 3D. This gameplay mechanic is one that hadn't been
                            seen before and hasn't really been seen since. It's a very cool mechanic that opens up a lot
                            of exploration and puzzle-solving opportunities.

                            as helpless as she has been in past games, but
                            she also maintains her kind and thoughtful personality, giving her the best of both worlds.
                            Her abilities have to do with her parasol. She can slow down her fall speed dramatically by
                            opening her parasol in midair, allowing her to cross long gaps. She can also defend and
                            seek
                            shelter under her parasol by pressing down to duck, making her invulnerable to damage, but

                            Boomer is a bomb Pixl who just loves exploding. That's pretty much all he cares about in
                            life. His main ability is <topic>exploding</topic> (as you may have guessed). He can explode
                            cracked walls,
                            as well as switches. His fuse timer allows for solutions to time-based puzzles. His
                            explosions are also good for damaging enemies. You can even combo Thoreau and Boomer
                            together to throw Boomer's bomb before he explodes.

                            Slim is a very chill and laid-back Pixl. He likes to live in the now and is very "go with
                            the flow". His main ability allows Mario to <topic>flip sideways</topic> to become virtually
                            invisible to
                            our camera view. If Mario stands still, he can become completely intangible, allowing him to

                            Carrie is a more mellow Pixl who is just happy to help. She had to make sure Mario shared
                            the same opinions as her before joining him. Her main ability is

                            Mario to hover around on. This allows him to travel over spikes and lava, as well as jump on

                            with Bowser to allow him to breathe fire in midair, making Carrie and Bowser a formidable
                            duo.

                            Barry is a completely optional Pixl who you can miss if you're not careful. In terms of
                            personality, he's more of a "keep to himself" kind of Pixl. He's happy to help Mario but
                            needs to know he can trust him first, which is why he is optional. His ability
                            produces a <topic>temporary shield</topic> around the user, making them invulnerable to
                            attacks while it's
                            active. It is also a spiky shield and thus damages any enemies that come into contact with
                            it. The shield can also be used to reflect projectiles back to the sender.

                            shed. His main ability allows Mario to <topic>flip the fabric of reality</topic> within a
                            square area. This
                            lets him uncover secret items hidden on the other side, and it can also be used on enemies
                            to make them dizzy.

                            Cudge is a very energetic Pixl who loves shouting catchphrases. When Mario first meets him,
                            he asks Mario what his favourite catchphrase is. His ability allows Mario to wield a trusty
                            <topic>hammer</topic> again, allowing him to damage spiked enemies that he otherwise
                            couldn't jump on. It
                            also allows him to break hammer-specific blocks that he couldn't before. Having the hammer
                            added to your moveset is incredibly useful. Cudge is another ability that I like to have
                            active
                            often.

                            size. This is
                            useful to fit into tiny gaps that Mario couldn't before. It's also useful in combat because
                            enemies can't see you, but you are still able to deal regular damage, making you the
                            ultimate stealth operative.

                            Piccolo is the final optional Pixl, which you get by doing an extensive side-quest. She

                            After Count Bleck takes everybody away from Bowser's Castle except for Mario, he is soon
                            found by the Pixl Tippi. Tippi takes Mario to her hometown, <topic>Flipside</topic>, which
                            is a dimension
                            between dimensions. Upon arriving, it becomes very apparent that the worlds and people Mario
                            will meet throughout the game will be a bit more extraordinary. They are a lot more
                            geometric in composition, adding to the other-worldly feel that the game goes for.
                            Otherwise, the town of Flipside is quite peaceful and homey, with an extremely relaxing and
                            nostalgic song to go with it. Flipside is where you return to after each chapter and
                            expands as you go. Each new ability, Pixl, and character you unlock opens up new areas to
                            explore, making Flipside a joy to run around in. Mario first visits <topic>Merlon</topic>,
                            who lives in
                            Flipside. He tells Mario all about the dark prophecy book, called the Dark Prognosticus.

                            receiving his
                            mission, Merlon gives him his first Pure Heart, which, as the name suggests, are hearts
                            with pure energy that can counteract the Chaos Heart that Count Bleck is using. After
                            receiving a Pure Heart, Mario must search Flipside and find a <topic>Heart Pillar</topic> to
                            set it upon.
                            Once he does, a door leading to the dimension with the next Pure Heart opens.

                            As with every Paper Mario game we've seen so far, the introductory chapter is always
                            incredibly strong at instilling a sense of adventure. The first area,
                            <topic>Lineland Road</topic>, is a
                            great introduction to the more platforming-centric gameplay of Super Paper Mario. It even
                            directly takes sections from the very first Mario Game! This is where Mario gets his
                            dimension-flipping ability from Bestovious.<img class="inline boss2"
                                src="Images/spm/bestovious.png" alt="Bestovious"> After the grassy plains, Mario scales
                            <topic>Mount Lineland</topic>, finding Thoreau at the end of the road. After the mountain,
                            Mario
                            travels through the
                            <topic>Yold Desert</topic>, encountering one of Count Bleck's minions, O'Chunks. He's a very
                            loud and proud,
                            but not-so-smart guy, who also isn't too difficult to beat. After the desert, Mario makes
                            his way into the <topic>Yold Ruins</topic>, which is the main dungeon of the chapter. It
                            gives a
                            spooky
                            sense of abandonment and feels very cool to make your way through. It is here
                            where you get
                            the first real taste of the puzzle <img class="boss4 imageR png"

                            Mario makes his way outside, where he finds the guardian of the Pure Heart,

                            ground! After a while, she wakes up with no memory as to what happened and joins Mario in

                            Gloam Valley. <topic>Gloam Valley</topic> is a very orange-hued place, with an orange sunset
                            as well as
                            orange water! About halfway through Gloam Valley, Mario and Peach find their second Pixl,
                            Boomer. At the end of Gloam Valley's path, they arrive at <topic>Merlee's Mansion</topic>.
                            This is where
                            the game got pretty creepy for me as a kid, taking a very horror-esque and cryptic angle.
                            Merlee's Mansion is completely isolated and empty inside, apart from one of Count Bleck's
                            underlings, Mimi,<img class="boss2 inline" src="Images/spm/mimi.png" alt="Mimi">whom Mario
                            is led to believe is Merlee's maiden. After a while of
                            exploring the empty mansion, Mario ends up breaking Mimi's favourite vase by mistake, giving
                            her grounds to sentence him to practically eternal servitude within the mansion. He has been
                            sentenced to a fine of 1 000 000 rubees and has to work that debt off. After a very long
                            time working, Mario finds another Pixl, Slim, hidden within a wall. With Slim's power, Mario
                            is able to bypass securities and unlock the secret vault, containing
                            exactly 1 000 000
                            rubees, freeing him of his debt. After this, <topic>Mimi</topic> completely throws away the
                            facade and
                            shape-shifts into her true self. <img class="boss3 imageR png"

                            tries to find Merlee amid all this chaos. Being chased by this spider thing gave me
                            nightmares as a kid! But after a while, Mario finds the true Merlee,<img

                            Chapter 3 is very platforming-centric. It begins with Tippi being kidnapped by a
                            nerdy chameleon named Francis. Mario thus has to move as fast as he can to get her back. To
                            get to Francis' base, Fort Francis, the Pixl Barry gives him directions. Mario
                            first travels
                            through the <topic>Open Plane</topic> of the Bitlands, which is a grassy area heavily
                            inspired by the
                            old-school Mario platformers. Mario ends up meeting Bowser on the way, who had been
                            setting
                            up a bit of a fortress for himself. After battling with Bowser, Mario and Peach are able to
                            convince him to join their <img class="boss4 imageL png" src="Images/spm/bigblooper.png"

                                alt="Bowser"> Mario then swims through the <topic>Tile Pool</topic>, which is the first
                            and only fully underwater section of the game. Along the way, Mario finds Thudley the Pixl
                            in a
                            nearby cave. Mario then has to fight a massive blooper on the
                            way. After he gets out of the water, he finds a massive tree, called the
                            <topic>Dotwood Tree</topic>, that
                            he has to scale in order to move forward. Inside the tree is a large mixture of platforming
                            and puzzling elements, revolving around making platforms disappear and reappear in the
                            correct order.

                            consists of a lot of funny gags about nerd culture, like anime, comic books, cats, and

                            They do a very good job with the humour in this place. While in the fortress, Mario rescues
                            Carrie the Pixl from a cage that Francis had put her in. Afterwards, Mario confronts

                            but before they fight, Francis becomes infatuated with Princess Peach, resulting in a very
                            amusing dating sim segment of the encounter, which is one of the most memorable gags of
                            the
                            game. The developers weren't at all afraid to go beyond the Mario conventions with this
                            game. <img class="boss1 imageR png" src="Images/spm/francis.png" alt="Francis">
                            After the dating-sim, Mario, Peach, and Bowser all battle Francis to save Tippi.
                            After
                            they do this, because of how grateful Tippi was that Mario came to save her, the Pure Heart
                            literally comes out of her from all her gratitude and trust, which was what needed to occur
                            for
                            that particular Pure Heart to come to light.

                            Chapter 4 takes Mario and co. out into <topic>space</topic>! A lot of this chapter is like
                            playing an
                            old-school space shooter game with a new ally named Squirps.<img class="inlineTop"
                                src="Images/spm/squirps.png" alt="Squirps"> When Mario first meets him,
                            he's not entirely sure if he can be trusted, but goes along with him anyway. Halfway
                            through the chapter, Mario and the gang land on a nearby planet, called <topic>Planet
                                Blobule</topic>, so
                            that Squirps can go to the bathroom. However, the one stall on the planet is occupied by
                            Fleep, and there's no toilet paper left! Thus Mario spends a good chunk of time exploring
                            the planet, trying to find paper for Fleep to use so that everyone can move forward. After
                            all this, Squirps tells the group that the Pure Heart can be found in a place called the
                            Whoa Zone. <topic>The Whoa Zone</topic> is a very extensive and convoluted maze that
                            requires you to think
                            quite a bit to make your way through it. Its main puzzle gimmick <img
                                class="boss3 imageR png" src="Images/spm/brobot.png" alt="Brobot">is shifting the
                            gravity of the entire place. Once Mario and the group make it through, awaiting them is none
                            other than... Luigi? Actually, it is <topic>Mr. L</topic>! Mr. L is Luigi's alter ego,
                            created by Count
                            Bleck's underling, Nastasia <img class="inline boss2" src="Images/spm/nastasia.png"
                                alt="Nastasia"><img class="boss1 imageR png" src="Images/spm/mrl.png" alt="Mr. L">when
                            she used a spell on Luigi. He's more confident than Luigi is, but is also
                            more cocky. He built a large robot, called the Brobot, that he uses to
                            try and defeat
                            Mario. Mario ultimately triumphs, and Mr. L flees back to Count Bleck. Afterwards, Squirps
                            provides the heroes with the next Pure Heart.

                            Cragnons are a group of cavemen-like

                            hadn't been evil at all. They were kidnapping the Cragnons because they were polluting the

                            settled, the Floro-Sapiens give the heroes King Croacus' Pure Heart, and the crew leaves

                            This chapter is where things start to get real in the story. Mario and Co. get taken next to
                            <topic>Sammer's Kingdom</topic>, which is a kingdom filled solely with samurai-like
                            inhabitants, called
                            Sammer Guys. When
                            Mario arrives, he is greeted by the king, King Sammer,<img class="inline boss2"
                                src="Images/spm/kingsammer.png" alt="King Sammer"> who is the
                            possessor of the next Pure Heart. He says that if Mario is able to defeat the 100-round
                            gauntlet of Sammer Guys, then he will have earned the pure heart. More noticeable than that,
                            <topic>The ever-growing Void</topic> created by Count Bleck is ginormous here, making it
                            feel very
                            precarious. And so, with the clock not on his side, Mario begins fighting the 100 Sammer
                            Guys, one by one. This gets pretty tedious fast, but I think that only adds to the genius of
                            the storytelling in this chapter. I think this because the gameplay that you are doing in
                            this chapter is very mindless, allowing your brain to focus on everything else around
                            you, like the void. After nearly every Sammer Guy you beat, it rumbles again and again as it
                            continues to expand, looming over the heroes as they hurriedly make their way through the
                            Sammer Guys. After defeating about 20 of the Sammer Guys, Count Bleck<img
                                class="inline boss2" src="Images/spm/countbleck.png" alt="Count Bleck">himself emerges
                            to
                            tell
                            the heroes that the void is about to destroy the entire Sammer Kingdom. When Tippi tries to
                            talk some sense into him, Count Bleck appears to go soft, withdrawing with a
                            hesitant
                            voice,
                            eluding to the fact that something more is going on between the two of them.

                            just continues to run past them, one at a time, not even batting an eye. Not long after,
                            what Count Bleck said comes true. In
                            a spectacular yet horrifying fashion, the entire world, and all its inhabitants, are
                            essentially <topic>deleted from existence</topic>, leaving the heroes in an empty, blank

                            before he gets a chance to, Dimentio shows up in Merlon's house and sends Mario, Peach,

                            effectively the underworld in this game. After getting his bearings, Mario realizes that
                            neither Peach nor Bowser is with him. They had been sent to other parts of The Underwhere.
                            Continuing forward, Mario eventually finds the queen of The Underwhere, Queen Jaydes, and
                            seeks her help. He explains that he hadn't actually died, and needed to get back to the real
                            world. He also asked for her assistance with the dead Pure Heart, as if anyone could have
                            helped, it was her. She agrees to try and help but asks in return for Mario to find her

                            that leads out of The Underwhere, passing quizzes of door guards as they go. Eventually,

                            wind up running into Bowser, who had been locked up by some guards. Bowser throws a bit of a
                            tantrum and tries to fight Mario again, but loses. Then he rejoins the team, and the three
                            of them make their way out of The Underwhere and toward the Overthere, which is essentially
                            Heaven. To reach The Overthere, the group first has to do a very long and convoluted climb
                            up the <topic>Overthere Stair</topic>. Along the way, they find Princess Peach incapacitated
                            next to a tree
                            growing magical apples. Luvbi tells Mario that they need to find a different type of magical
                            apple somewhere in the Overthere Stair that will wake Peach up. After many times testing
                            various apples, going back and forth, they find the apple that wakes Peach up, and she joins
                            the crew once again. We now finally have the full group of four heroes.

                            transformed into a Nimbi to conceal its true self, and that Grambi and Queen Jaydes
                            were not Luvbi's real parents. After coming to terms with this, Luvbi allows herself to
                            fully transform and bestows herself to the heroes. At last, they have secured every last

                            After collecting all 8 Pure Hearts, our four heroes now have to face their greatest
                            challenge yet. They have to storm <topic>Count Bleck's Castle</topic>. Going through this
                            castle is nothing
                            short of amazing, as well as terrifying. The all-black design makes the castle extremely
                            foreboding to travel through. Not to mention your skills actually feel very tested in this
                            chapter, with numerous difficult and strong enemies. This castle also tests your
                            platforming, as well as the abilities of all four heroes and all the Pixls. It's a true
                            gauntlet that fulfills all the practice you've had with the game's mechanics. This castle
                            also has a perfect song for the occasion, giving a sense of foreboding power as well as a
                            sense of urgency and stakes. After making their way through part of the castle, the heroes
                            have a run-in
                            with <topic>O'Chunks</topic> again. Bowser volunteers to go head-to-head with O'Chunks and
                            defeats him
                            swiftly. However, just as the heroes begin making their way past, the ceiling begins to
                            fall, about to crush them. Then, out of nowhere, O'Chunks gets under the ceiling and holds
                            it up, allowing the heroes to pass. Bowser also stays behind to help hold the ceiling up, as
                            Mario, Peach, and Luigi move forward. The second they close the door behind them,
                            they hear
                            the ceiling crash to the floor, and the door is locked. With no choice but to
                            press onward,
                            the three remaining heroes continue to make their way
                            through the
                            Castle. After a little
                            while, the heroes encounter <topic>Mimi</topic> next. <img class="imageR boss1 png"

                            opens up,

                            With despair looming over the brothers after Peach's disappearance, they
                            head deeper into the castle, with no other choice. After more puzzling, jumping, and
                            battling, the brothers next encounter <topic>Dimentio</topic> once again. It is now Luigi's
                            turn to stay
                            back and fight, as Mario goes on ahead. After Luigi defeats Dimentio, Dimentio does some
                            strange magic on him, setting off an explosion in the process. When Mario hears this, again,
                            he tries to go back, but he already knew the result before trying the door, it was locked.
                            Now Mario was left completely alone, with Bowser, Princess Peach, and Luigi all lost, Mario
                            had to press on through the dark, gloomy, fear-inducing castle, with nobody else to lean on.
                            Silently, Mario makes his way forward alone, until he reaches the very end, where
                            <topic>Count Bleck</topic> awaits him. With nothing else
                            on his mind, Mario jumps into action and battles head-to-head with Count Bleck. However, he
                            is dealing no damage to him. Count Bleck's Chaos Heart
                            cast an impenetrable shield <img class="boss3 imageR png" src="Images/spm/countbleck.png"

                            expresses great remorse for what he has done but exclaims that there's no way to stop it.
                            Right then and there, none other than <topic>Dimentio</topic> springs out of nowhere and
                            attacks Count

                            destruction of all worlds to come true, and then become the ruler of the new
                            universe that

                            lovers from long ago, having once been named Blumiere and Timpani! Then, O'Chunks and Mimi
                            also join in convincing Count Bleck that it's not over and that they can help put a stop to
                            Dimentio. At this, Count Bleck expresses his gratitude to the loyalty of his Minions, and
                            this reignites the Pure Hearts once again! The hearts rally together to destroy Dimentio's
